An efficient cloud security architecture should recognize the issues that will arise with security management and follow all the best practices, procedures, and guidelines to ensure a secure cloud environment. Security management addresses these issues with security controls. These controls protect cloud environments and are put in place to safeguard any weaknesses in the system and reduce the effect of an attack.\n\nDeterrent controls\nAdministrative mechanisms intended to reduce attacks by informing attackers of consequences.\nPreventive controls\nControls designed to reduce vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access.\nDetective controls\nControls that detect and respond to security events. Includes monitoring, SIEM, IDS/IPS, malware detection.\nCorrective controls\nControls that reduce the impact of an incident and restore systems.\n\n\n== Dimensions of cloud security ==\nCloud security engineering is characterized by the security layers, plan, design, programming, and best practices that exist inside a cloud security arrangement. Cloud security engineering requires the composed and visual model (design and UI) to be characterized by the tasks inside the Cloud. This cloud security engineering process includes such things as access to the executives, techniques, and controls to ensure applications and information. It also includes ways to deal with and keep up with permeability, consistency, danger stance, and by and large security. Processes for imparting security standards into cloud administrations and activities assume an approach that fulfills consistent guidelines and essential foundation security parts.\nThough the idea of cloud computing is not new, organizations are increasingly adopting it because of its flexible scalability, relative trustability, and cost-effectiveness of services. However, despite its rapid adoption in some sectors and disciplines, research and statistics indicate that security-related pitfalls remain a major barrier to its full adoption.\nIt is generally recommended that information security controls be selected and implemented in proportion to the risks, typically by assessing the threats, vulnerabilities and impacts. Cloud security concerns can be grouped in various ways; Gartner identified seven, while the Cloud Security Alliance identified twelve areas of concern. Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) are software that sits between cloud users and cloud applications to provide visibility into cloud application usage, data protection and governance to monitor all activity and enforce security policies.",

Prior to this appointment, Graham was Director General of the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority.\nChristopher Graham's father, David Maurice Graham (1911\u201399), served as a broadcaster with the BBC External Services from 1939 to 1971. He reported on the liberation of the Nazi death camps and Indian independence, and subsequently specialised in covering Eastern Europe. As an undergraduate, he had played a leading role in The King and Country debate of 1933 at the Oxford Union. David Graham's father, Sir Lancelot Graham (1880-1958), was the first Governor of Sind in British India (now Pakistan).\nChristopher Graham was a boy chorister at Canterbury Cathedral. He went on to St Edward's School, Oxford, then Liverpool University, where he took a BA in History, serving as President of the Guild of Undergraduates (1971-72). He was a Liverpool City Councillor from 1971 to 1974, being one of the youngest people ever elected to a local council in the UK. He was elected as a Liberal and served as a councillor for St. Michael's ward. Prior to his appointment as Director General of the ASA in 2000, Graham had worked for the BBC since the mid-1970s, including serving as Secretary to the Board of Governors. In the general elections of 1983 and 1987 he stood unsuccessfully as the Liberal-SDP Alliance candidate for the North Wiltshire parliamentary constituency. On both occasions, he came second to the Conservative candidate.\nGraham married Mary Crockett, a journalist with The Scotsman, in April 2010.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "context": "=== Debate over federal or state data breach notification laws ===\nMost scholars, like Angela Daly, advocate for federal data breach notification laws emphasize the problem with having varying forms of data breach notification laws. That is, companies are forced to comply with multiple state data breach notification laws. This creates increased difficulty to comply with the laws and the costs. In addition, scholars have argued that a state-by-state approach has created the problem of uncompensated victims and inadequate incentives to persuade companies and governments to invest in data security.\nAdvocates of a state-by-state approach to data breach notification laws emphasize increased efficiency, increased incentives to have the local governments increase data security, limited federal funding available due to multiple projects, and lastly states are able to quickly adapt and pass laws to constantly evolving data breach technologies. In 2018, a majority of state attorneys general opposed a proposed federal data breach notification law that would preempt state laws.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nData breaches occur because of technical issues like bad code to economic issues causing competing firm to not cooperate with each other to tackle data security. In response, data breach notification laws attempt to prevent harm to companies and the public.\n\n\n=== Criminal impact ===\nA serious harm of data breaches is identity theft. Identity theft can harm individuals when their personal data is stolen and is used by another party to create financial harm such as withdrawing their money, non financially such as fraudulently claiming their health benefits, and pretending to be them and committing crimes. Based on data collected from 2002 to 2009 from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the use of data breach notification has helped to decrease identity theft by 6.1 percent.\n\n\n=== Economic impact ===\nOverall, data breach notifications leads to decreasing market value, evident in publicly traded companies experiencing a decrease in market valuation. Other costs include loss of consumer confidence and trust in the company, loss of business, decreased productivity, and exposure to third-party liability. Notably, the type of data that is leaked from the breach has varying economic impact. A data breach that leaks sensitive data experiences harsher economic repercussions.",

        "context": "In the history of cryptography, a grille cipher was a technique for encrypting a plaintext by writing it onto a sheet of paper through a pierced sheet (of paper or cardboard or similar). The earliest known description is due to Jacopo Silvestri in 1526. His proposal was for a rectangular stencil allowing single letters, syllables, or words to be written, then later read, through its various apertures. The written fragments of the plaintext could be further disguised by filling the gaps between the fragments with anodyne words or letters. This variant is also an example of steganography, as are many of the grille ciphers.\n\n\n== Cardan grille and variations ==\n\nThe Cardan grille was invented as a method of secret writing. The word cryptography became the more familiar term for secret communications from the middle of the 17th century.  Earlier, the word steganography was common. The other general term for secret writing was cypher - also spelt cipher.  There is a modern distinction between cryptography and steganography\nSir Francis Bacon gave three fundamental conditions for ciphers.  Paraphrased, these are:\n\na cipher method should not be difficult to use\nit should not be possible for others to recover the plaintext (called 'reading the cipher')\nin some cases, the presence of messages should not be suspected\nIt is difficult to fulfil all three conditions simultaneously.  Condition 3 applies to steganography.  Bacon meant that a cipher message should, in some cases, not appear to be a cipher at all. The original  Cardan Grille met that aim.\nVariations on the Cardano original, however, were not intended to fulfill condition 3 and generally failed to meet condition 2 as well. But, few  if any ciphers have ever achieved this second condition, so the point is generally a cryptanalyst's delight whenever the grille ciphers are used.\nThe attraction of a grille cipher for users lies in its ease of use (condition 1).  In short, it's very simple.\n\n\n=== Single-letter grilles ===",

Stacking the shares we have all the subpixels associated with the black pixel now black while 50% of the subpixels associated with the white pixel remain white.\n\n\n== Cheating the (2, n) visual secret sharing scheme ==\nHorng et al. proposed a method that allows n \u2212 1 colluding parties to cheat an honest party in visual cryptography. They take advantage of knowing the underlying distribution of the pixels in the shares to create new shares that combine with existing shares to form a new secret message of the cheaters choosing.\nWe know that 2 shares are enough to decode the secret image using the human visual system. But examining two shares also gives some information about the 3rd share. For instance, colluding participants may examine their shares to determine when they both have black pixels and use that information to determine that another participant will also have a black pixel in that location. Knowing where black pixels exist in another party's share allows them to create a new share that will combine with the predicted share to form a new secret message. In this way a set of colluding parties that have enough shares to access the secret code can cheat other honest parties.\n\n\n== Visual steganography ==\n\n2\u00d72 subpixels can also encode a binary image in each component image. For example, each white pixel of each component image could be represented by two black subpixels, while each black pixel represented by three black subpixels.\nWhen overlaid, each white pixel of the secret image is represented by three black subpixels, while each black pixel is represented by all four subpixels black. Each corresponding pixel in the component images is randomly rotated to avoid orientation leaking information about the secret image.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn \"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\", a 1967 episode of TV series The Prisoner, the protagonist uses a visual cryptography overlay of multiple transparencies to reveal a secret message \u2013 the location of a scientist friend who had gone into hiding.",

These mechanisms center on two HIPAA de-identification standards \u2013 Safe Harbor and the Expert Determination Method. Safe harbor relies on the removal of specific patient identifiers (e.g. name, phone number, email address, etc.), while the Expert Determination Method requires knowledge and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods to render information not individually identifiable.\n\n\n=== Safe harbor ===\nThe safe harbor method uses a list approach to de-identification and has two requirements:\n\nThe removal or generalization of 18 elements from the data.\nThat the Covered Entity or Business Associate does not have actual knowledge that the residual information in the data could be used alone, or in combination with other information, to identify an individual. Safe Harbor is a highly prescriptive approach to de-identification. Under this method, all dates must be generalized to year and zip codes reduced to three digits. The same approach is used on the data regardless of the context. Even if the information is to be shared with a trusted researcher who wishes to analyze the data for seasonal variations in acute respiratory cases and, thus, requires the month of hospital admission, this information cannot be provided; only the year of admission would be retained.\n\n\n=== Expert Determination ===\nExpert Determination takes a risk-based approach to de-identification that applies current standards and best practices from the research to determine the likelihood that a person could be identified from their protected health information. This method requires that a person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods render the information not individually identifiable. It requires:\n\nThat the risk is very small that the information could be used alone, or in combination with other reasonably available information, by an anticipated recipient to identify an individual who is a subject of the information;\nDocuments the methods and results of the analysis that justify such a determination.",

The industrial facility operator would have no way of knowing the data has been compromised, until someone such as a security engineer recognized the attack was occurring. As operators are trained to provide a prompt, appropriate response to stabilize the industrial facility, there is a likelihood that the corrupt data would lead to the operator reacting to the situation and lead to a plant upset. In a resilient control system, as per Fig. 2, cyber and physical data is fused to recognize anomalous situations and warn the operator.\n2) As our society becomes more automated for a variety of drivers, including energy efficiency, the need to implement ever more effective control algorithms naturally follow. However, advanced control algorithms are dependent upon data from multiple sensors to predict the behaviors of the industrial operation and make corrective responses. This type of system can become very brittle, insofar as any unrecognized degradation in the sensor itself can lead to incorrect responses by the control algorithm and potentially a worsened condition relative to the desired operation for the industrial facility. Therefore, implementation of advanced control algorithms in a resilient control system also requires the implementation of diagnostic and prognostic architectures to recognize sensor degradation, as well as failures with industrial process equipment associated with the control algorithms.",

The 56-bit key of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) is no longer considered adequate in the face of modern cryptanalytic techniques and supercomputing power; Triple DES increases the effective security to 112 bits. A CVE released in 2016, CVE-2016-2183, disclosed a major security vulnerability in the DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of 3DES, led to NIST deprecating 3DES in 2019 and disallowing all uses (except processing already encrypted data) by the end of 2023. It has been replaced with the more secure, more robust AES.\nWhile US government and industry standards abbreviate the algorithm's name as TDES (Triple DES) and TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm), RFC 1851 referred to it as 3DES from the time it first promulgated the idea, and this namesake has since come into wide use by most vendors, users, and cryptographers.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1978, a triple encryption method using DES with two 56-bit keys was proposed by Walter Tuchman; in 1981, Merkle and Hellman proposed a more secure triple-key version of 3DES with 112 bits of security.\n\n\n== Standards ==\nThe Triple Data Encryption Algorithm is variously defined in several standards documents:\n\nRFC 1851, The ESP Triple DES Transform (approved in 1995)\nANSI ANS X9.52-1998 Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Modes of Operation (approved in 1998, withdrawn in 2008)\nFIPS PUB 46-3 Data Encryption Standard (DES) (approved in 1999, withdrawn in 2005)\nNIST Special Publication 800-67 Revision 2 Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher (approved in 2017, withdrawn in 2024)\nISO/IEC 18033-3:2010: Part 3: Block ciphers (approved in 2005)",

The Feistel based algorithm was first published in 1987 by Akihiro Shimizu and Shoji Miyaguchi from NTT. The cipher is susceptible to various forms of cryptanalysis, and has acted as a catalyst in the discovery of differential and linear cryptanalysis.\nThere have been several different revisions of FEAL, though all are Feistel ciphers, and make use of the same basic round function and operate on a 64-bit block. One of the earliest designs is now termed FEAL-4, which has four rounds and a 64-bit key. \nProblems were found with FEAL-4 from the start: Bert den Boer related a weakness in an unpublished rump session at the same conference where the cipher was first presented. A later paper (den Boer, 1988) describes an attack requiring 100\u201310000 chosen plaintexts, and Sean Murphy (1990) found an improvement that needs only 20 chosen plaintexts. Murphy and den Boer's methods contain elements similar to those used in differential cryptanalysis.\nThe designers countered by doubling the number of rounds, FEAL-8 (Shimizu and Miyaguchi, 1988). However, eight rounds also proved to be insufficient \u2014 in 1989, at the Securicom conference, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir described a differential attack on the cipher, mentioned in (Miyaguchi, 1989). Gilbert and Chass\u00e9 (1990) subsequently published a statistical attack similar to differential cryptanalysis which requires 10000 pairs of chosen plaintexts.",

The proximity of the People's Republic of China give strategic importance to Indo-Burmese relations. The Indo-Burmese border stretches over 1,600 kilometers. India is generally friendly with Myanmar, but is concerned by the flow of tribal refugees and the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi.\nAs a result of increased Chinese influence in Myanmar as well as the safe haven and arms trafficking occurring along the Indo-Burmese border, India has sought in recent years to refurbish ties with the Union of Burma. Numerous economic arrangements have been established including a roadway connecting the isolated provinces of Northeastern India with Mandalay which opens up trade with China, Myanmar, and gives access to the Burmese ports. Relations between India and Myanmar have been strained in the past however due to India's continuing support for the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar.\nIn an interview on the BBC, George Fernandes, former Indian Defence Minister and prominent Myanmar critic, said that Coco Island was part of India until it was donated to Myanmar by former Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru. Coco Island is located at 18 km from the Indian Nicobar Islands.\nMyanmar has a fully operating embassy based in New Delhi and India has one in Yangon, the former capital of Myanmar.

A common approach (brute-force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password. Another type of approach is password spraying, which is often automated and occurs slowly over time in order to remain undetected, using a list of common passwords.\nThe purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password (due to the fact that installing an entirely new password would involve System Administration privileges), to gain unauthorized access to a system, or to act as a preventive measure whereby system administrators check for easily crackable passwords. On a file-by-file basis, password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence to which a judge has allowed access, when a particular file's permissions restricted.\nBrute-force password guessing attacks against online systems are usually ineffective because systems are designed to lock accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts. Obtaining the cryptographic hash of the password makes it possible to perform an unlimited number of offline guesses. Hash files can might be obtained by third parties by court-ordered access, or as part of an illegal data breach. If passwords are reused across web sites, the hash file obtained from one web site can be used for cracking, and then the discovered passwords can be attempted against the same email addresses on other web sites. \nThe password spraying approach evades account lockout countermeasures by guessing the same password across many accounts, allowing time to pass between attempts on the same account, which might include legitimate logins. This approach does not target specific accounts.",

Those states included Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, Arizona, California, Iowa, Texas, and Wisconsin. Currently, hackers only reportedly succeeded in breaching the voter registration system of one state: Illinois. There was no evidence of votes being changed.\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 hacking, a growing bench of national security and cyber experts have emerged noting that Russia is just one potential threat. Other actors including North Korea, Iran, organized criminals possess, and individual hackers have motives and technical capability to infiltrate or interfere with elections and democratic operations.  Leaders and experts have warned that a future attack on elections or voting infrastructure by Russian-backed hackers or others with nefarious intent, such as seen in 2016, is likely in 2018 and beyond.\nOne recommendation to prevent disinformation from fake election-related web sites and email spoofing is for local governments to use .gov domain names for web sites and email addresses. These are controlled by the federal government, which authenticates the legitimate government controls the domain.

Software overwrite may also be problematic in high-security environments, which require stronger controls on data commingling than can be provided by the software in use. The use of advanced storage technologies may also make file-based overwrite ineffective (see the related discussion below under \u00a7 Complications).\nThere are specialized machines and software that are capable of doing overwriting. The software can sometimes be a standalone operating system specifically designed for data destruction. There are also machines specifically designed to wipe hard drives to the department of defense specifications DOD 5220.22-M.\nWriting zero to each block on hard disks and SSDs has the advantage of affording the firmware to deploy spare blocks when bad blocks are identified. Bitlocker has the advantage that data is illegible without the key. Seatools and other tools can erase disks with zero which is typical to revive old consumer class disks but they can wipe server disks albeit slowly. Modern 28TB and larger disks have an enormous number of LBA48 blocks. 40TB and 60TB disks will take proportionately longer times to wipe.",

        "context": "== Model strengths and weaknesses ==\nThe single largest strength of any TOFU-style model is that a human being must initially validate every interaction. A common application of this model is the use of ssh-rpc 'bot' users between computers, whereby public keys are distributed to a set of computers for automated access from centralized hosts. The TOFU aspect of this application forces a sysadmin (or other trusted user) to validate the remote server's identity upon first connection.\nFor end-to-end encrypted communication the TOFU model allows authenticated encryption without the complex procedure of obtaining a personal certificate which are vulnerable to CA Compromise. Compared to Web of Trust, TOFU has less maintenance overhead.\nThe largest weakness of TOFU that requires manual verification is its inability to scale for large groups or computer networks. The maintenance overhead of keeping track of identifiers for every endpoint can quickly scale beyond the capabilities of the users.\nIn environments where the authenticity of the identifier cannot be verified easily enough (for example, the IT staff of workplace or educational facility might be hard to reach), the users tend to blindly trust the identifier of the opposing endpoint. Accidentally approved identifiers of attackers may also be hard to detect if the man-in-the-middle attack persists.\nAs a new endpoint always involves a new identifier, no warning about potential attack is displayed. This has caused misconception among users that it's safe to proceed without verifying the authenticity of the initial identifier, regardless of whether the identifier is presented to the user or not.\nWarning fatigue has pushed many messaging applications to remove blocking warnings to prevent users from reverting to less secure applications that do not feature end-to-end encryption in the first place.\nOut-of-sight identifier verification mechanisms reduce the likelihood that secure authentication practices are discovered and adopted by the users.",

Most commonly it is a title given to a government regulator in the fields of freedom of information and the protection of personal data in the widest sense. The office often functions as a specialist ombudsman service.\n\n\n== Australia ==\nThe Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has functions relating to freedom of information and privacy, as well as information policy.  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner, which was the national privacy regulator, was integrated into the OAIC on 1 November 2010.  There are three independent commissioners in the OAIC: the Australian Information Commissioner, the Freedom of Information Commissioner, and the Privacy Commissioner.\n\n\n== Bangladesh ==\nThe Information Commission of Bangladesh promotes and protects access to information.  It is formed under the Right to Information Act, 2009, whose stated object is to empower the citizens by promoting transparency and accountability in the working of the public and private organizations, with the ultimate aim of decreasing corruption and establishing good governance. The Act creates a regime through which the citizens of the country may have access to information under the control of public and other authorities.\n\n\n== Canada ==\nThe Information Commissioner of Canada is an independent ombudsman appointed by the Parliament of Canada who investigates complaints from people who believe they have been denied rights provided under Canada's Access to Information Act. Similar bodies at provincial level include the Information and Privacy Commissioner (Ontario).\n\n\n== Germany ==\nThe Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (FfDF) is the federal commissioner not only for data protection but also (since commencement of the German Freedom of Information Act on January 1, 2006) for freedom of information.\n\n\n== Hong Kong ==\nThe Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) is charged with education and enforcement of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which first came into force in 1997.  The commissioner has the power to investigate and impose fines for violations.  Reforms in 2021 gave it powers to investigate and prosecute suspected doxxing incidents.",

These weaknesses may exist for many reasons, including original design or poor configuration. Due to the nature of backdoors, they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals.\nBackdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons. Criminals often use malware to install backdoors, giving them remote administrative access to a system. Once they have access, cybercriminals can \"modify files, steal personal information, install unwanted software, and even take control of the entire computer.\"\nBackdoors can be difficult to detect, as they often remain hidden within the source code or system firmware intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer.\n\n\n=== Denial-of-service attack ===\nDenial-of-service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim's account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points. In this case, defending against these attacks is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques, including distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS), where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim. With such attacks, the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves. To understand why attackers may carry out these attacks, see the 'attacker motivation' section.\n\n\n=== Physical access attacks ===",

Only certification organs authorized for such kinds of works, have right to perform such function;\nCertification laboratories performs tests and measurements of safety indicators or quality of the evaluated objects. Such laboratory must have equipment and trained staff (and test methods) to perform its activities. Existence of all the resources is proved by the Attestation of Authorization of the laboratory in the given sphere of activity;\nApplicants are individual entrepreneurs or Russian legal entities (in some cases foreign manufacturers), that intend to go through evaluation process to prove the conformity of their production to the legal requirements or some other certain requirements of the system of certification (to which it applied).\nThere is a great variety of objects for certification (different products and manufacturing processes, management systems, construction sites, etc.). A little smaller is the lists of risks that may be encountered by using some products and from which consumers should be protected. The variety of certification systems in Russia is explained by these two factors and by the wish of some corporations to introduce their own requirements for the product's deliverers.\nThere two big groups of certification systems in Russia: voluntary and obligatory ones. From the names, it is clear that the evaluation of conformity for the objects of obligatory certification system appears to be mandatory requirement for all Russian manufacturers and for the products from abroad.\n\n\n== Obligatory certification ==\nIt is only federal state structure who can create the obligatory certification system of Russia. The system must go through the procedure of state registration. The Rosstandart which is responsible for the certification in Russia as a whole keeps a registry of the RF certification systems. Only after receiving the Certificate of state registration with getting the unique registration number, may activities be performed in evaluating conformity as a new system.\nThere are 16 obligatory certification systems in Russia:",

A q*-block is l-diverse if it contains l \"well represented\" values for the sensitive attribute S. A table is l-diverse, if every q*-block in it is l-diverse.\nThe paper t-Closeness: Privacy beyond k-anonymity and l-diversity (2007) defines l-diversity as being:\n\nThe l-diversity Principle \u2013 An equivalence class is said to have l-diversity if there are at least l \u201cwell-represented\u201d values for the sensitive attribute. A table is said to have l-diversity if every equivalence class of the table has l-diversity.\nMachanavajjhala et al. (2007) define \u201cwell-represented\u201d in three possible ways:\n\nDistinct l-diversity \u2013 The simplest definition ensures that at least l distinct values for the sensitive field in each equivalence class exist.\nEntropy l-diversity \u2013 The most complex definition defines Entropy of an equivalent class E to be the negation of summation of s across the domain of the sensitive attribute of p(E,s)log(p(E,s)) where p(E,s) is the fraction of records in E that have the sensitive value s. A table has entropy l-diversity when for every equivalent class E, Entropy(E) \u2265 log(l).\nRecursive (c-l)-diversity \u2013 A compromise definition that ensures the most common value does not appear too often while less common values are ensured to not appear too infrequently.\nAggarwal and Yu (2008) note that when there is more than one sensitive field the l-diversity problem becomes more difficult due to added dimensionalities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nt-closeness\nk-anonymity\nDifferential privacy\n\n\n== References ==",

        "context": "=== Common implementation errors ===\nDue to its relative simplicity of implementation, and due to its promise of perfect secrecy, one-time-pad enjoys high popularity among students learning about cryptography, especially as it is often the first algorithm to be presented and implemented during a course. Such \"first\" implementations often break the requirements for information theoretical security in one or more ways:\n\nThe pad is generated via some algorithm, that expands one or more small values into a longer \"one-time-pad\". This applies equally to all algorithms, from insecure basic mathematical operations like square root decimal expansions, to complex, cryptographically secure pseudo-random random number generators (CSPRNGs). None of these implementations are one-time-pads, but stream ciphers by definition. All one-time pads must be generated by a non-algorithmic process, e.g. by a hardware random number generator.\nThe pad is exchanged using non-information-theoretically secure methods. If the one-time-pad is encrypted with a non-information theoretically secure algorithm for delivery, the security of the cryptosystem is only as secure as the insecure delivery mechanism. A common flawed delivery mechanism for one-time-pad is a standard hybrid cryptosystem that relies on symmetric key cryptography for pad encryption, and asymmetric cryptography for symmetric key delivery. Common secure methods for one-time pad delivery are quantum key distribution, a sneakernet or courier service, or a dead drop.\nThe implementation does not feature an unconditionally secure authentication mechanism such as a one-time MAC.\nThe pad is reused (exploited during the Venona project, for example).\nThe pad is not destroyed immediately after use.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n=== Applicability ===\nDespite its problems, the one-time-pad retains some practical interest. In some hypothetical espionage situations, the one-time pad might be useful because encryption and decryption can be computed by hand with only pencil and paper. Nearly all other high quality ciphers are entirely impractical without computers. In the modern world, however, computers (such as those embedded in mobile phones) are so ubiquitous that possessing a computer suitable for performing conventional encryption (for example, a phone that can run concealed cryptographic software) will usually not attract suspicion.",

In 2017, DHS confirmed that a U.S. foreign adversary, Russia, attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election via \"a multi-faceted approach intended to undermine confidence in [the American] democratic process.\" This included conducting cyber espionage against political targets, launching propaganda or \"information operations\" (IO) campaigns on social media, and accessing elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards.\nOn September 22, 2017, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified 21 states that they were targeted by Kremlin-backed hackers during the 2016 election. Those states included Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, Arizona, California, Iowa, Texas, and Wisconsin. Currently, hackers only reportedly succeeded in breaching the voter registration system of one state: Illinois. There was no evidence of votes being changed.\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 hacking, a growing bench of national security and cyber experts have emerged noting that Russia is just one potential threat. Other actors including North Korea, Iran, organized criminals possess, and individual hackers have motives and technical capability to infiltrate or interfere with elections and democratic operations.  Leaders and experts have warned that a future attack on elections or voting infrastructure by Russian-backed hackers or others with nefarious intent, such as seen in 2016, is likely in 2018 and beyond.\nOne recommendation to prevent disinformation from fake election-related web sites and email spoofing is for local governments to use .gov domain names for web sites and email addresses. These are controlled by the federal government, which authenticates the legitimate government controls the domain. Many local governments use .com or other top-level domain names; an attacker could easily and quickly set up an altered copy of the site on a similar-sounding .com address using a private registrar.",

In interviews following his firing, Matze noted that his termination may have been related to a dispute within the company regarding his belief that the company needed to \"crack down\" on domestic terrorism and violence and be \"a little more pragmatic while still respecting free speech\", but he was \"not exactly sure\" why he had been fired. Matze also said his suggestion to implement a moderation policy to remove extremist content was overruled by Mercer.\nAmy Peikoff, Parler's Chief Policy Officer, provided a statement to Fox News in which she disputed Matze's memo to staff as \"inaccurate and misleading\", though she did not specify to which statements she was objecting. Parler investor Dan Bongino published a video on Facebook after Matze's departure, accusing Matze of \"really bad decisions\" leading to Parler being taken offline and causing app stability issues, and saying that Matze \"decided to make this public, not us. We were handling it like gentlemen.\"\nOn February 19, Parler briefly banned Matze's account before restoring it later that day after BuzzFeed News contacted a Parler spokesperson about the banning. This banning came after Matze made a post on Parler asking his followers what they thought the \"fair market value\" of the company was.\nOn March 22, in Clark County, Nevada, Matze filed a lawsuit against Parler's board, alleging that Rebekah Mercer and Parler's board members engaged in a scheme to steal Matze's share in Parler.",

        "context": "=== Text-dependent speaker verification ===\nVarious devices use speaker recognition to verify the identity of a speaker. In text-dependent systems, an attacker can record the target individual\u2019s speech that was correctly verified by the system, then play the recording again to be verified by the system. A counter-measure was devised using spectral bitmaps from the stored speech of verified users. Replayed speech has a different pattern in this scenario and will then be rejected by the system.\n\n\n=== Replay attacks on IoT devices ===\nIn the realm of smart home environments, Internet of things (IoT) devices are increasingly vulnerable to replay attacks, where an adversary intercepts and replays legitimate communication signals between an IoT device and its companion app. These attacks can compromise a wide array of devices, including smart plugs, security cameras, and even household appliances.\nA recent study demonstrated that a substantial portion of consumer IoT devices are prone to replay attacks. Researchers found that 75% of tested devices supporting local connectivity were vulnerable to such attacks. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to mimic legitimate commands, potentially enabling unauthorized actions such as turning on a smart kettle, unlocking doors, or manipulating security systems. Such breaches pose significant safety, security, and privacy risks, as malicious actors can gain control over critical home systems.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nIn the folk tale Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, the thieves' captain used the passphrase \"Open, Sesame\" to open the door to their loot depot. This was overheard by Ali Baba, who later reused the passphrase to get access and collect as much of the loot as he could carry.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDenial-of-service attack\nDigest access authentication\nMan-in-the-middle attack\nPre-play attack\nRelay attack\nSession replay\nTelephone tapping\n\n\n== References ==",

        "context": "== Secure channels in the real world ==\n\nThere are no perfectly secure channels in the real world. There are, at best, only ways to make insecure channels (e.g., couriers, homing pigeons, diplomatic bags, etc.) less insecure: padlocks (between courier wrists and a briefcase), loyalty tests, security investigations, guns for courier personnel, diplomatic immunity for diplomatic bags, and so forth.\nIn 1976, two researchers proposed a key exchange technique (now named after them)\u2014Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange (D-H). This protocol allows two parties to generate a key only known to them, under the assumption that a certain mathematical problem (e.g., the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem in their proposal) is computationally infeasible (i.e., very very hard) to solve, and that the two parties have access to an authentic channel. In short, that an eavesdropper\u2014conventionally termed 'Eve', who can listen to all messages exchanged by the two parties, but who can not modify the messages\u2014will not learn the exchanged key. Such a key exchange was impossible with any previously known cryptographic schemes based on symmetric ciphers, because with these schemes it is necessary that the two parties exchange a secret key at some prior time, hence they require a confidential channel at that time which is just what we are attempting to build.\nMost cryptographic techniques are trivially breakable if keys are not exchanged securely or, if they actually were so exchanged, those keys become known in some other way (burglary or extortion, for instance). An actually secure channel will not be required if an insecure channel can be used to securely exchange keys, and if burglary, bribery, or threat aren't used. The eternal problem has been and of course remains\u2014even with modern key exchange protocols\u2014how to know when an insecure channel worked securely (or alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, when it did not), and whether anyone has actually been bribed or threatened or simply lost a notebook (or a notebook computer) with key information in it. These are hard problems in the real world and no solutions are known\u2014only expedients, jury rigs, and workarounds.\n\n\n== Future possibilities ==",

No independent confirmation has been made that such a negotiation took place.\nIn August 2022, Adam Bies, a man in rural Mercer County, Pennsylvania, was charged with making death threats against FBI agents on Gab after the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago. Torba had given data from Bies to the FBI, including an email, IP addresses, and chat logs. In response, Gab users accused Torba of betraying Gab's userbase and commitment to free speech, as well as likening Torba to Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus. Many users criticized Torba for giving the data to the FBI without a subpoena. In response, Torba did not apologize for cooperating with the FBI, said that \"threatening anyone\u2014federal agent or not\u2014is not the right way to do it\", and said that Gab is dedicated to upholding \"lawful speech and lawful speech only.\" While some Gab users accepted the response from Torba, others continued to criticize him.

Although some EU member countries reluctantly accepted this resolution out of privacy concerns (which are more pronounced in Europe than the US), there appears now to be general agreement with the resolution. Interception mandates in Europe are generally more rigorous than those of the US; for example, both voice and ISP public network operators in the Netherlands have been required to support interception capabilities for years. In addition, publicly available statistics indicate that the number of interceptions in Europe exceed by many hundreds of times those undertaken in the U.S.\nEurope continues to maintain its global leadership role in this sector through the adoption by the European Parliament and Council in 2006 of the far reaching Data Retention Directive. The provisions of the Directive apply broadly to almost all public electronic communications and require the capture of most related information, including location, for every communication. The information must be stored for a period of at least six months, up to two years, and made available to law enforcement upon lawful request. The Directive has been widely emulated in other countries.

Most attacks are focused on making a total break by finding the secret key f instead of just recovering the message m.\nIf f is known to have very few non-zero coefficients Eve can successfully mount a brute force attack by trying all values for f. When Eve wants to know whether f\u00b4 is the secret key, she simply calculates \n  \n    \n      \n         \n        \n          \n            \n              f\n            \n          \n          \u2032\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          \n            h\n          \n        \n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          q\n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ {\\textbf {f}}'\\cdot {\\textbf {h}}{\\pmod {q}}}\n  \n. If it has small coefficients it might be the secret key f, and Eve can test if f\u00b4 is the secret key by using it to decrypt a message she encrypted herself.\nEve could also try values of g and test if  \n  \n    \n      \n         \n        \n          \n            \n              g\n            \n          \n          \u2032\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          \n            \n              h\n            \n          \n          \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          q\n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ {\\textbf {g}}'\\cdot {\\textbf {h}}^{-1}{\\pmod {q}}}\n  \nhas small values.\nIt is possible to mount a meet-in-the-middle attack which is more powerful.

Visa and Mastercard require merchants and service providers to be validated according to the PCI DSS; Visa also offers a Technology Innovation Program (TIP), an alternative program which allows qualified merchants to discontinue the annual PCI DSS validation assessment. Merchants are eligible if they take alternative precautions against fraud, such as the use of EMV or point-to-point encryption.\nIssuing banks are not required to undergo PCI DSS validation, although they must secure sensitive data in a PCI DSS-compliant manner. Acquiring banks must comply with PCI DSS and have their compliance validated with an audit. In a security breach, any compromised entity which was not PCI DSS-compliant at the time of the breach may be subject to additional penalties (such as fines) from card brands or acquiring banks.\n\n\n== Legal status ==\nNo governing body/agency requires or enforces PCI DSS compliance, but if any PCI DSS requirements conflict with country, state, or local law, the law will apply. The European Union\u2019s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legislative standard governing personal data. GDPR has similar security control standards as PCI DSS in regards to cardholder data because cardholder data is considered a form of personal data under GDPR. Hence, for many European organizations, a PCI DSS breach often constitutes a GDPR breach as well, which can result in fines from both major payment card brands and the European Union. These GDPR fines can be up to \"\u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global turnover\" (whichever is greatest).",

The emails had been released by the US State Department under a Freedom of information request in February 2016. WikiLeaks also created a search engine to allow the public to search through Clinton's emails. In July 2016, just prior to the publication of the UK government's Iraq Inquiry report, WikiLeaks published a selection of the emails referencing the Iraq War.\nOn 19 July 2016, in response to the Turkish government's purges that followed the coup attempt, WikiLeaks released 294,548 emails from Turkey's ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). According to WikiLeaks, the material, which it said was the first batch from the \"AKP Emails\", was obtained a week before the attempted coup in the country and \"is not connected, in any way, to the elements behind the attempted coup, or to a rival political party or state\". After WikiLeaks announced that it would release the emails, the organisation was for over 24 hours under a \"sustained attack\". Following the leak, the Turkish government ordered the site to be blocked nationwide.\nOn 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released approximately 20,000 emails and 8,000 files sent from or received by Democratic National Committee (DNC) personnel. Some of the emails contained personal information of donors, including home addresses and Social Security numbers. Other emails appeared to criticise Bernie Sanders or showed favouritism towards Clinton during the primaries. In July 2016, Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as chairwoman of the DNC because the emails released by WikiLeaks showed that the DNC was \"effectively an arm of Mrs. Clinton's campaign\" and had conspired to sabotage Sanders's campaign.",

        "context": "In cryptography, domain separation is a construct used to implement multiple different functions  using only one underlying template in an efficient way. The domain separation can be defined as partitioning of the domain of a function to assign separate subdomains to different applications of the same function.\nFor example, cryptographic protocols typically rely on random oracles (ROs, functions that return a value fully determined by their input yet otherwise random). The security proofs for these protocols are based on the assumption that the random oracle is unique to the protocol: if two protocols share the same RO, the assumptions of the proof are not met anymore. Since creating a new cryptographic primitive from scratch each time an RO is needed is impractical,  multiple ROs (say, RO1 and RO2) are produced by prepending unique domain separation tags (DSTs, also known as domain separators) to the input of a base oracle RO:\n\nRO1(x) := RO(\"RO1\" || x)\nRO2(x) := RO(\"RO2\" || x)\nwhere \"RO1\" and \"RO2\" are the strings representing the unique DSTs and || is a concatenation operator. If the underlying RO function is secure (say, it is a cryptographic hash), RO1 and RO2 are statistically independent. The technique was originally proposed by Bellare & Rogaway in 1993.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe domain separation construct can be used for multiple purposes:\n\nproviding independent ROs for protocols;\nextending the output size of an RO (for example, by using the RO multiple times (numbered from 1 to L), each time using a representation of oracle number as a DST. This technique is called \"counter mode\" due to its similarity to the counter mode of a block cipher;\n\"keying\" the oracle by using an encryption key as a DST.\nIn the practical sense, the domain separation can provide \"customization\", an equivalent of the strong typing in programming: it enforces the use of independent calculations for different tasks, so an attacker that had learned a result of one calculation will get no information about another one.\n\n\n== Kinds of functions ==\nDomain separation can be used with functions implementing different cryptographic primitives.",

It is closely related to BaseKing; the two are variants of the same general cipher technique.\n3-Way has a block size of 96 bits, notably not a power of two such as the more common 64 or 128 bits. The key length is also 96 bits. The figure 96 arises from the use of three 32 bit words in the algorithm, from which also is derived the cipher's name. When 3-Way was invented, 96-bit keys and blocks were quite strong, but more recent ciphers have a 128-bit block, and few now have keys shorter than 128 bits. 3-Way is an 11-round substitution\u2013permutation network.\n3-Way is designed to be very efficient in a wide range of platforms from 8-bit processors to specialized hardware, and has some elegant mathematical features which enable nearly all the decryption to be done in exactly the same circuits as did the encryption.\n3-Way, just as its counterpart BaseKing, is vulnerable to related key cryptanalysis.

        "context": "=== Comparison with United States data protection law ===\nAs of 2003, the United States has no single data protection law comparable to the EU's Data Protection Directive.\nUnited States privacy legislation tends to be adopted on an ad hoc basis, with legislation arising when certain sectors and circumstances require (e.g., the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988, the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA (US)). Therefore, while certain sectors may already satisfy parts of the EU Directive most do not. The United States prefers what it calls a 'sectoral' approach to data protection legislation, which relies on a combination of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation, rather than governmental regulation alone. Former US President Bill Clinton and former Vice-President Al Gore explicitly recommended in their \"Framework for Global Electronic Commerce\" that the private sector should lead, and companies should implement self-regulation in reaction to issues brought on by Internet technology.\nThe reasoning behind this approach has as much to do with American laissez-faire economics as with different social perspectives. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. While free speech is an explicit right guaranteed by the United States Constitution, privacy is an implicit right guaranteed by the Constitution as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, although it is often an explicit right in many state constitutions.\nEurope's extensive privacy regulation is justified with reference to experiences under World War II-era fascist governments and post-War Communist regimes, where there was widespread unchecked use of personal information. World War II and the post-War period was a time in Europe when disclosure of race or ethnicity led to secret denunciations and seizures that sent friends and neighbours to work camps and concentration camps. In the age of computers, Europeans' guardedness of secret government files has translated into a distrust of corporate databases, and governments in Europe took decided steps to protect personal information from abuses in the years following World War II.  (Germany) and France, in particular, set forth comprehensive data protection laws.",

Speaking to The Washington Post after the hoax, Cottle described Parler's security as a \"joke\". The Daily Dot also described \"what appeared to be some pretty serious security flaws\" in Parler in a report pertaining to the incident. Watkins himself was vocally critical of Parler and its security on Twitter after the spoofing incident, describing the service as \"compromised\".\nAlso in mid-November, security researcher Kevin Abosch claimed to have discovered weaknesses in Parler's user verification information, alleging 5,000 accounts were compromised in July 2020. Matze calling the alleged hack \"fake\", adding that the service is protected by \"multiple layers of security\". As of late November, no evidence that the site used vulnerable WordPress technology as claimed had surfaced.\nIn January 2021, following the storming of the Capitol and just before Parler went offline, a researcher scraped roughly eighty terabytes of public Parler posts. The scraped data included more than a million videos, which maintained GPS metadata identifying the exact locations where the videos were recorded, as well as text and images. Some of the data included posts that users had attempted to delete. The researcher stated her intention was to make a public record of \"very incriminating\" evidence against those who took part in the storming. The data dump was posted online, and the researcher has said the data will eventually be made available by the Internet Archive. According to Ars Technica and Wired, the reason the researcher was able to scrape the data so easily was due to the Parler website's poor coding quality and security flaws. There was no authentication or rate limiting on the API, and deleted posts were \"soft deleted\": a flag was added to hide them, but they were not actually deleted. According to Wired, although all posts downloaded by the researcher were public, because Parler didn't scrub metadata, GPS coordinates of many users' homes had likely been exposed.",

        "context": "Parler (pronounced \"parlor\") is an American alt-tech social networking service associated with conservatives. Launched in August 2018, Parler marketed itself as a free speech-focused and unbiased alternative to mainstream social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Journalists described Parler as an alt-tech alternative to Twitter, with its users including those banned from mainstream social networks or who oppose their moderation policies.\nParler received criticism for its content policies, which some journalists and users claimed were more restrictive than the company portrayed. Conservatives praised Parler as offering an alternative to censorship they claim to endure on more mainstream platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter.\nParler's userbase grew exponentially during 2020 with minimal content moderation. After reports that Parler was used to coordinate the 2021 United States Capitol attack, several companies denied it their services. Apple and Google removed Parler's mobile app from their app stores, and Parler went offline on January 10, 2021, when Amazon Web Services canceled its hosting services. Before it went offline in January 2021, according to Parler, the service had about 15 million users. Parler called the removals \"a coordinated attack by the tech giants to kill competition in the marketplace\". Parler resumed service on February 15, 2021, after moving domain registration to Epik. A version of the app with added content filters was released on the Apple App Store on May 17, 2021. Parler returned to Google Play on September 2, 2022.\nParler was acquired by the digital media conglomerate Starboard on April 14, 2023, and was shut down on the same day. According to a statement by Starboard on the website's holding page, now removed, this was a temporary measure to allow the site to \"undergo a strategic assessment\".\nOn December 15, 2023, the company was sold to a new co-owner group consisting of Ryan Rhodes, Elise Pierotti and Jaco Booyens. Ryan Rhodes was appointed CEO. The app became available on the Apple App store in April 2024 as invite only.",

        "context": "=== Uses ===\nPseudorandom generators have numerous applications in cryptography. For instance, pseudorandom generators provide an efficient analog of one-time pads. It is well known that in order to encrypt a message m in a way that the cipher text provides no information on the plaintext, the key k used must be random over strings of length |m|. Perfectly secure encryption is very costly in terms of key length. Key length can be significantly reduced using a pseudorandom generator if perfect security is replaced by semantic security. Common constructions of stream ciphers are based on pseudorandom generators.\nPseudorandom generators may also be used to construct symmetric key cryptosystems, where a large number of messages can be safely encrypted under the same key. Such a construction can be based on a pseudorandom function family, which generalizes the notion of a pseudorandom generator.\nIn the 1980s, simulations in physics began to use pseudorandom generators to produce sequences with billions of elements, and by the late 1980s, evidence had developed that a few common generators gave incorrect results in such cases as phase transition properties of the 3D Ising model and shapes of diffusion-limited aggregates. Then in the 1990s, various idealizations of physics simulations\u2014based on random walks, correlation functions, localization of eigenstates, etc., were used as tests of pseudorandom generators.\n\n\n=== Testing ===\nNIST announced SP800-22 Randomness tests to test whether a pseudorandom generator produces high quality random bits.

        "context": "In cryptography, the Fiat\u2013Shamir heuristic, or Fiat\u2013Shamir transformation, is a technique for taking an interactive proof of knowledge and creating a digital signature based on it. This way, some fact (for example, knowledge of a certain secret number) can be publicly proven without revealing underlying information. The technique is due to Amos Fiat and Adi Shamir (1986). For the method to work, the original interactive proof must have the property of being public-coin, i.e. verifier's random coins are made public throughout the proof protocol.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe heuristic was originally presented without a proof of security; later, Pointcheval and Stern proved its security against chosen message attacks in the random oracle model, that is, assuming random oracles exist. This result was generalized to the quantum-accessible random oracle (QROM) by Don, Fehr, Majenz and Schaffner, and concurrently by Liu and Zhandry. In the case that random oracles do not exist, the Fiat\u2013Shamir heuristic has been proven insecure by Shafi Goldwasser and Yael Tauman Kalai. The Fiat\u2013Shamir heuristic thus demonstrates a major application of random oracles. More generally, the Fiat\u2013Shamir heuristic may also be viewed as converting a public-coin interactive proof of knowledge into a non-interactive proof of knowledge. If the interactive proof is used as an identification tool, then the non-interactive version can be used directly as a digital signature by using the message as part of the input to the random oracle.",

        "context": "== Key management ==\nThe Symmetric & Asymmetric Database Encryption section introduced the concept of public and private keys with basic examples in which users exchange keys. The act of exchanging keys becomes impractical from a logistical point of view, when many different individuals need to communicate with each-other. In database encryption the system handles the storage and exchange of keys. This process is called key management. If encryption keys are not managed and stored properly, highly sensitive data may be leaked. Additionally, if a key management system deletes or loses a key, the information that was encrypted via said key is essentially rendered \"lost\" as well. The complexity of key management logistics is also a topic that needs to be taken into consideration. As the number of application that a firm uses increases, the number of keys that need to be stored and managed increases as well. Thus it is necessary to establish a way in which keys from all applications can be managed through a single channel, which is also known as enterprise key management. Enterprise Key Management Solutions are sold by a great number of suppliers in the technology industry. These systems essentially provide a centralised key management solution that allows administrators to manage all keys in a system through one hub. Thus it can be said that the introduction of enterprise key management solutions has the potential to lessen the risks associated with key management in the context of database encryption, as well as to reduce the logistical troubles that arise when many individuals attempt to manually share keys.",

In 1932, Ernst Kramer of Lorenz used this antenna in developing a system radiating a dot-dash tone to one side of the beam and a dash-dot on the other; when on path, the tone would be continuous. Called Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer (LEF) or commonly, Lorenz beam, this system was sold worldwide for aircraft guidance and blind landing.\nHans Plendt at the German Laboratory for Aviation investigated changes in the LEF commercial system to allow more direct guidance for Luftwaffe aircraft and also to give relatively precise location to the aircraft; this was particularly useful for bomb-release points. Code-named X-Leitstrahlbake (Directional Beacon), this was accepted by the Luftwaffe in 1937. Lorenz received a contract for supplying the ground equipment, and the aircraft receivers were the same as used in the LEF. By 1939, Germany had installed X-Leitstrahlbake stations radiating into other countries, including Great Britain, but they did not raise suspicions since the signals were essentially the same as those from the standard Lorenz LEF system. The X-Leitstrahlbake was used when night-time bombing began in 1940. The British developed countermeasure beams, followed by further improvements by the Germans.",

The data would be confidential, controlled, integral, authentic, and available\u2013they just wouldn't be useful in that form.\nThe conversion of salary data from one currency into an inappropriate currency would be a breach of utility, as would the storage of data in a format inappropriate for a specific computer architecture; e.g., EBCDIC instead of ASCII or 9-track magnetic tape instead of DVD-ROM.\nA tabular representation of data substituted for a graph could be described as a breach of utility if the substitution made it more difficult to interpret the data.\nUtility is often confused with availability because breaches such as those described in these examples may also require time to work around the change in data format or presentation.

        "context": "In cryptography, the McEliece cryptosystem is an asymmetric encryption algorithm developed in 1978 by Robert McEliece. It was the first such scheme to use randomization in the encryption process. The algorithm has never gained much acceptance in the cryptographic community, but is a candidate for \"post-quantum cryptography\", as it is immune to attacks using Shor's algorithm and \u2013 more generally \u2013 measuring coset states using Fourier sampling.\nThe algorithm is based on the hardness of decoding a general linear code (which is known to be NP-hard). For a description of the private key, an error-correcting code is selected for which an efficient decoding algorithm is known, and that is able to correct \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t}\n  \n errors. The original algorithm uses binary Goppa codes (subfield codes of algebraic geometry codes of a genus-0 curve over finite fields of characteristic 2); these codes can be efficiently decoded, thanks to an algorithm due to Patterson. The public key is derived from the private key by disguising the selected code as a general linear code. For this, the code's generator matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  \n is perturbated by two randomly selected invertible matrices \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  \n (see below).\nVariants of this cryptosystem exist, using different types of codes. Most of them were proven less secure; they were broken by structural decoding.\nMcEliece with Goppa codes has resisted cryptanalysis so far. The most effective attacks known use information-set decoding algorithms. A 2008 paper describes both an attack and a fix. Another paper shows that for quantum computing, key sizes must be increased by a factor of four due to improvements in information set decoding.\nThe McEliece cryptosystem has some advantages over, for example, RSA. The encryption and decryption are faster. For a long time, it was thought that McEliece could not be used to produce signatures. However, a signature scheme can be constructed based on the Niederreiter scheme, the dual variant of the McEliece scheme. One of the main disadvantages of McEliece is that the private and public keys are large matrices. For a standard selection of parameters, the public key is 512 kilobits long.",

ISO/IEC 27001:2005 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization's overall business risks.

The primary goal of information security is to control access to information. The value of the information is what must be protected. These values include confidentiality, integrity and availability. Inferred aspects are privacy, anonymity and verifiability.\nThe goal of security management comes in two parts:\n\nSecurity requirements defined in service level agreements (SLA) and other external requirements that are specified in underpinning contracts, legislation and possible internal or external imposed policies.\nBasic security that guarantees management continuity. This is necessary to achieve simplified service-level management for information security.\nSLAs define security requirements, along with legislation (if applicable) and other contracts. These requirements can act as key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be used for process management and for interpreting the results of the security management process.\nThe security management process relates to other ITIL-processes.
