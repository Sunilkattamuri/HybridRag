The service focuses on security, privacy, and compliance with EU regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It addresses concerns about European dependence on non-EU DNS providers and associated data privacy and cybersecurity risks.\nThe service operates entirely within EU borders to ensure GDPR compliance and prohibits data monetization. Regional threat intelligence sharing via CERTs enables rapid response to cyber threats across multiple EU countries simultaneously.\nDNS4EU operates as a voluntary service that is not controlled by the European Commission, supporting net neutrality principles and avoiding censorship. The EU does not have access to configuration data or user information, and the service complies with local regulations required of internet service providers. \n\n\n== Services ==\nDNS4EU offers three main categories of DNS resolution services.",

Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as white hat, grey hat, black hat and script kiddie. In contrast to Raymond, they usually reserve the term cracker for more malicious activity.\nAccording to Ralph D.

The RADINT (radar intelligence) discipline involves learning to recognize a radar both by its primary signal, captured by ELINT, and its sidelobes, perhaps captured by the main ELINT sensor, or, more likely, a sensor aimed at the sides of the radio antenna.\nMASINT associated with COMINT might involve the detection of common background sounds expected with human voice communications. For example, if a given radio signal comes from a radio used in a tank, if the interceptor does not hear engine noise or higher voice frequency than the voice modulation usually uses, even though the voice conversation is meaningful, MASINT might suggest it is a deception, not coming from a real tank.",
