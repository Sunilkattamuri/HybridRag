        "context": "== Legal challenge ==\nThe Privacy Shield has been challenged legally by privacy groups. Initially, it was not clear whether the cases would be considered admissible. However, by February 2017 the future of the Privacy Shield was contested. One consultant, Matt Allison, predicted that \"The EU's citizen-driven, regulated model will swiftly come into conflict with the market forces of the US and the UK.\" Allison summarized a new paper in which the European Commission lays out its plans for adequacy decisions and global strategy.\nIn December 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a preliminary opinion in the Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland case (also known as Schrems II). It outlined various scenarios that may result from the conflict in regimes. One lawyer concluded that the opinion \"should generate equal measures of relief and alarm for the U.S. government and for companies dependent on data transfers.\"\nA final CJEU decision was published on 16 July 2020 in Schrems II. The EU\u2013US Privacy Shield for data sharing was struck down by the European Court of Justice on the grounds it did not provide adequate protections to EU citizens from government surveillance. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), an EU organization whose decisions are binding for national privacy supervisory authorities, declared that, \"transfers on the basis of this legal framework are illegal\". The ruling did not completely stop data transfers between the EU and other foreign countries as the court upheld the use of \"standard contractual clauses\" (SCCs). But SCCs do not necessarily protect data in countries where the law is fundamentally incompatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), like the US. The existing impasse was the subject of ongoing academic proposals and research.\nOn 25 March 2022 the US and EU announced that a new data transfer agreement had been reached. The new framework, called the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, would allow EU citizens to pursue data privacy violations through a new \"Data Protection Review Court\". On 7 October 2022 President Biden signed an executive order to implement the European Union-U.S. data transfer framework, which adopts new American intelligence gathering privacy safeguards.\nA decision regarding the impact of Brexit on Privacy Shield was expected by 31 December 2020, but may be moot due to the CJEU decision.\nThe new version is subject to criticism.",

The BankID may be in the form of a certificate file on disk, on card or on smart phones. The latter (Swedish mobile BankID service) was used by 84 percent of the Swedish population in 2019. A Mobile BankID login does not require a fee since the service is provided by banks rather than mobile operators. It can be used both for authentication within various apps and web services on the same smart phone, and also for web pages on other devices. It also supports fingerprint and face recognition authentication on compatible iOS and Android devices.\nElectronic IDs are used for secure web login to Swedish authorities, banks, health centers (allowing people to see their medical records and prescriptions and book doctors visits), and companies such as pharmacies. Mobile BankID also allows the Swish mobile payment service, utilized by 78 percent of the Swedish population in 2019, at first mainly for payments between individuals. BankID was previously used for university applications and admissions, but this was prohibited by Swedbank since universities utilized the system for distribution of their own student logins. Increasingly, BankID is used as an added security for signing contracts.\n\n\n=== Usage of eID systems in Europe ===\nThe adoption of eIDs varies per EU Member State. While some countries mainly rely on government eID systems, others have dominant private or public-private systems, like eIDs managed by banks.

Nonetheless, many people use the terms \"virus\" and \"worm\" interchangeably to describe any self-propagating program.\nKeystroke logging\nA keylogger is a tool designed to record (\"log\") every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval, usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine. Some keyloggers use virus-, trojan-, and rootkit-like methods to conceal themselves. However, some of them are used for legitimate purposes, even to enhance computer security. For example, a business may maintain a keylogger on a computer used at a point of sale to detect evidence of employee fraud.\nAttack patterns\nAttack patterns are defined as series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system.

In 1933, sensing the political turmoil in the world which eventually led to the Second World War, the Intelligence Bureau's responsibilities were increased to include the collection of intelligence along India's borders.\nIn 1947, after independence, Sanjeevi Pillai took over as the first Indian Director of the IB. B. N. Mullik took over in 1950 until 1965. Having been depleted of trained manpower by the exit of the British after Indian independence, Pillai tried to run the bureau on MI5 lines. In 1949, Pillai organised a small foreign intelligence set-up, but the Indian debacle in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 showed it to be ineffective. The Directorate General of Security was created as a result.After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, the Chief of Army Staff, General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri, also called for more intelligence-gathering. The Mizo revolt in 1966 also acted as a reason for the changes in the external intelligence structure. Around the end of 1966 the concept of a separate foreign intelligence agency began to take concrete shape. \n\n\n=== Formation of R&AW in 1968 to present ===",

Anonymous also leaked 200 GB worth of emails from the Belarusian weapons manufacturer Tetraedr, which provided logistical support for Russia in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Anonymous also hacked into Russian TV channels and played Ukrainian music through them and showed uncensored news of what was happening in Ukraine.\nThey hacked into a Russian Center for the Protection of Monuments website (memorials.tomsk.ru) and uploaded three defacement pages adorned with the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag. In the first defacement page, they included the standard Anonymous logo, a music video of Mandopop song \"Fragile\", brief announcement that the Operation Samantha Smith has morphed into Operation Russia and Operation Ukraine while warned \"we will do what we must\" following the Russian military invasion, and a photo of Ukrainian revolutionary Nestor Makhno.\nFollowing through their threats during Operation Samantha Smith, Anonymous had also hacked a Chinese SIMATIC programmable logic controller along with two Russian Modbus devices. Memes from social-networking website Reddit appeared on the defaced website, including an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin in heavy makeup with a rainbow as a background, together with a series of embedded Reddit posts which asked users to vote for which parts of Russia should declare independence. Next, appearing on the hacked website are the Ukrainian national anthem, Ukrainian coat of arms and a map appearing to show Kuomintang plans for an invasion of China and the Soviet Union.",

More recently, the PCI SSC has collaborated with EMVCo, to provide the security requirements, testing procedures and assessor training to support the EMV 3-D Secure v2.0 standard.\n\n\n== Membership and participation ==\nMembers of the PCI Security Standards Council include an executive committee of six major payment brands: American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard, Visa Inc., and UnionPay. The executives and management of the PCI SSC are supported by 30 companies comprising the Board of Advisors, and other stakeholder advisory groups such as assessor companies and regional boards.\nInterested parties can participate in the development of the PCI security standards through member registration as a Participating Organization. Currently, there are more than 700 Participating Organizations from more than 60 countries. These participants are organized into Special Interest Groups, which are tasked with recommending revisions to and the further development of the various security standards maintained by the PCI SSC.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPCI DSS Compliance Requirement Checklist",

The BBC declined to produce the show and develop it further before creating effectively the same show on Radio 4 several years later, featuring some of the same cast, entitled Hut 33.\nBletchley came to wider public attention with the documentary series Station X (1999).\nThe 2012 ITV programme The Bletchley Circle is a set of murder mysteries set in 1952 and 1953. The protagonists are four female former Bletchley codebreakers, who use their skills to solve crimes. The pilot episode's opening scene was filmed on-site, and the set was asked to remain there for its close adaptation of the historic setting.\nThe 2018 programme The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco is a spin-off of The Bletchley Circle. It takes place in San Francisco and features two characters from the original series.\nIan McEwan's television play The Imitation Game (1980) concludes at Bletchley Park.\nBletchley Park was featured in the sixth and final episode of the BBC TV documentary The Secret War (1977), presented and narrated by William Woodard. This episode featured interviews with Gordon Welchman, Harry Golombek, Peter Calvocoressi, F. W. Winterbotham, Max Newman, Jack Good, and Tommy Flowers.\nThe Agent Carter season 2 episode \"Smoke & Mirrors\" reveals that Agent Peggy Carter worked at Bletchley Park early in the war before joining the Strategic Scientific Reserve.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nThe play Breaking the Code (1986) is set at Bletchley Park.",

The evolution of technology is such that the programs and systems used to input information will likely not be available to a user who desires to examine archived data. One proposed solution to the challenge of long-term accessibility and usability of data by future systems is to standardize information fields in a time-invariant way, such as with XML language.

The attacks originated in Guangdong, China. The activity is believed to be associated with a state-sponsored advanced persistent threat. It was given the designation Titan Rain by the federal government of the United States.\nTitan Rain hackers gained access to many United States defense contractor computer networks, which were targeted for their sensitive information, including those at Lockheed Martin, Sandia National Laboratories, Redstone Arsenal, and NASA.\n\n\n== Attackers ==\n\nThe attacks are reported to be the result of actions by People's Liberation Army Unit 61398. These hackers attacked both the US government (Defense Intelligence Agency) and the UK government (Ministry of Defence). In 2006, an \"organised Chinese hacking group\" shut down a part of the UK House of Commons computer system. The Chinese government has denied responsibility.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nThe U.S. government has blamed the Chinese government for the 2004 attacks. Alan Paller, SANS Institute research director, stated that the attacks came from individuals with \"intense discipline\" and that \"no other organization could do this if they were not a military\". Such sophistication has pointed toward the People's Liberation Army as the attackers.\nTitan Rain reportedly attacked multiple organizations, such as NASA and the FBI. Although no classified information was reported stolen, the hackers were able to steal unclassified information (e.g., information from a home computer) that could reveal strengths and weaknesses of the United States.\n\nTitan Rain has also caused distrust between other countries (such as the United Kingdom and Russia) and China. The United Kingdom has stated officially that Chinese hackers attacked its governmental offices. Titan Rain has caused the rest of the world to be more cautious of attacks not just from China but from other countries as well.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Apollo\nMoonlight Maze\nOperation Aurora\nShawn Carpenter\nStakkato\n\n\n== References ==",

The property of being resilient to unknown analyses is called transferability. Gr\u00f6ndahl & Asokan (2020b) identify four different threat models for authors, varying with their knowledge of how their text will be analysed and what training data will be used: query access, with the weakest analyst and the strongest author who knows both the methods of analysis and the training data; architecture access, where the author knows the analysis methods but not the training data; data access, where the author knows the training data but not the analysis methods; and surrogate access, with the weakest author and the strongest analyst, where the author does not know the methods of analysis nor the training data. Further, when an author chooses a method, they must rely on their threat model and trust that it is valid, and that unknown analyses able to detect remaining stylistic signals cannot or will not be performed, or that the masking successfully transfers; a stylometrist with knowledge of how the author attempted to mask their style, however, may be able to exploit some weakness in the method and render it unsafe. Much of the research into automated methods has assumed that the author has query access, which may not generalise to other settings. Masking methods that internally use an ensemble of different analyses as a model for its adversary may transfer better against unseen analyses.",

Heuristics may find an attacker within the network, but often generate so many alerts that critical alerts are missed. In a large enterprise, the alert volume may reach millions of alerts per day. Security operations personnel cannot process most of the activity easily, yet it only takes one successful penetration to compromise an entire network. This means cyber-attackers can penetrate these networks and move unimpeded for months, stealing data and intellectual property.\nDeception technology produces alerts that are the end product of a binary process. Probability is essentially reduced to two values: 0% and 100%. Any party that seeks to identify, ping, enter, view any trap or utilizes a lure is immediately identified as malicious by this behavior because anyone touching these traps or lures should not be doing so. This certainty is an advantage over the many extraneous alerts generated by heuristics and probability-based.\nBest practice shows that deception technology is not a stand-alone strategy. Deception technology is an additional compatible layer to the existing defense-in-depth cyber defense. Partner integrations make it most useful. The goal is to add protection for the most advanced and sophisticated human attackers that will successfully penetrate the perimeter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCybercrime\nNetwork security\nProactive cyber defense\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLance Spitzner (2002).

The EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) is intended to address these concerns.\nAfter the invalidation of the EU\u2013US Privacy Shield in July 2020, companies wishing to transfer data between the EU and the US \"have faced confusion, higher compliance costs, and challenges for EU\u2013US business relationships\".\nThe European Parliament raised substantial doubts whether the new agreement reached by Ursula von der Leyen actually conforms with EU laws, as it still does not sufficiently protect EU citizens from US mass surveillance and fails to enforce basic human digital rights in the EU. In May 2023, a resolution on this matter passed the European Parliament with 306 votes in favor and 27 against. The NGO NOYB (European Center for Digital Rights) has announced that it will challenge the framework again before the European Court of Justice.\nUnder the new Trump Administration doubts have arisen as to the future of the Framework.",

        "context": "=== In veterinary medicine ===\nIn UK veterinary practice, the replacement of paper recording systems with electronic methods of storing animal patient information escalated from the 1980s, and the majority of clinics now use electronic medical records. In a sample of 129 veterinary practices, 89% used a Practice Management System (PMS) for data recording. There are more than ten PMS providers currently in the UK. Collecting data directly from PMSs for epidemiological analysis abolishes the need for veterinarians to manually submit individual reports per animal visit and therefore increases the reporting rate.\nVeterinary electronic medical record data are being used to investigate antimicrobial efficacy, risk factors for canine cancer, and inherited diseases in dogs and cats in the small animal disease surveillance project 'VetCOMPASS' (Veterinary Companion Animal Surveillance System) at the Royal Veterinary College, London, in collaboration with the University of Sydney (the VetCOMPASS project was formerly known as VEctAR).\n\n\n== Synthetic and real patients (like 'Turing test' for EHRs) ==\nA letter published in Communications of the ACM describes the concept of generating synthetic patient populations and proposes a variation of the Turing test to assess the difference between synthetic and real patients. The letter states: \"In the EHR context, though a human physician can readily distinguish between synthetically generated and real live human patients, could a machine be given the intelligence to make such a determination on its own?\"\nFurther, the letter states: \"Before synthetic patient identities become a public health problem, the legitimate EHR market might benefit from applying Turing Test-like techniques to ensure greater data reliability and diagnostic value. Any new techniques must thus consider patients' heterogeneity and are likely to have greater complexity than the Allen eighth-grade-science-test is able to grade.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKubben, P.; Dumontier, M.; Dekker, A.

        "context": "== Difference from encryption ==\nTokenization and \"classic\" encryption effectively protect data if implemented properly, and a computer security system may use both. While similar in certain regards, tokenization and classic encryption differ in a few key aspects. Both are cryptographic data security methods and they essentially have the same function, however they do so with differing processes and have different effects on the data they are protecting.\nTokenization is a non-mathematical approach that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes without altering the type or length of data. This is an important distinction from encryption because changes in data length and type can render information unreadable in intermediate systems such as databases. Tokenized data can still be processed by legacy systems which makes tokenization more flexible than classic encryption.\nIn many situations, the encryption process is a constant consumer of processing power, hence such a system needs significant expenditures in specialized hardware and software.\nAnother difference is that tokens require significantly less computational resources to process. With tokenization, specific data is kept fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. This allows tokenized data to be processed more quickly and reduces the strain on system resources. This can be a key advantage in systems that rely on high performance.\nIn comparison to encryption, tokenization technologies reduce time, expense, and administrative effort while enabling teamwork and communication.\n\n\n== Types of tokens ==\nThere are many ways that tokens can be classified however there is currently no unified classification. Tokens can be: single or multi-use, cryptographic or non-cryptographic, reversible or irreversible, authenticable or non-authenticable, and various combinations thereof.\nIn the context of payments, the difference between high and low value tokens plays a significant role.",

He called using fronting in a circumvention tool \"now largely non-viable\" in the countries it was needed. It is, however, still used by some services, such as Tor and Lantern.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollateral freedom\nEncrypted SNI\nTelex (anti-censorship system)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFifield, David; Lan, Chang; Hynes, Rod; Wegmann, Percy; Paxson, Vern (2015). \"Blocking-resistant communication through domain fronting\" (PDF).

        "context": "== Categories ==\nGelb and Whiting classify the four situations of an undeciphered language and how difficult decipherment will be in each of them:\n\nType O: known writing and known language. Although decipherment in this case is trivial, useful information can be gleaned when a known language is written in an alphabet other than the one it is commonly written in. Studying the writing of the Phoenician or Sumerian languages in the Greek alphabet allows information about pronunciation and vocalization to be gleaned that cannot be obtained when studying the expression of these languages in their normal writing system.\nType I: unknown writing and known language. Deciphered languages in this category include Phoenician, Ugaritic, Cypriot, and Linear B. In this situation, alphabetic systems are the easiest to decipher, followed by syllabic languages, and finally the most difficult being logo-syllabic.\nType II: known writing and unknown language. An example is Linear A. Strictly speaking, this situation is not one of decipherment but of linguistic analysis. Decipherment in this category is considered extremely difficult to achieve on the basis of internal information only.\nType III: unknown writing and unknown language. Examples include the Archanes script and the Archanes formula, Phaistos disk, Cretan hieroglyphs, and Cypro-Minoan syllabary. When this situation occurs in an isolated culture and without the availability of outside information, decipherment is typically considered impossible.\n\n\n== Methods ==\nThere is no single recipe or linear method for decipherment, however: instead, philologists and linguists must rely on a set of heuristic devices that have been established. Broadly, it is important to be familiar with the relevant texts where the script or language occurs in, access to accurate drawings or photographs of these texts, information about their relative chronology, and background information on where the texts occur in (their geography, perhaps being found in the context of a funerary monument, etc). \nThese methods can be divided into approaches utilizing external or internal information.",

        "context": "==== United States criminal investigations ====\nThe US Justice Department began a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange soon after the leak of diplomatic cables in 2010 began. The Washington Post reported that the department was considering charges under the Espionage Act of 1917, an action which former prosecutors characterised as \"difficult\" because of First Amendment protections for the press. Several Supreme Court cases, while not conclusive, (e.g. Bartnicki v. Vopper) have established that the American Constitution protects the re-publication of illegally gained information provided the publishers did not themselves violate any laws in acquiring it. The question of criminal punishment or a civil injunction after publication, like in the WikiLeaks case, is less established.\nIn 2010, the NSA added Assange to its Manhunting Timeline. In August 2010, the Pentagon had concluded that the Afghan War documents leak broke the law. A letter from the Department of Defence general counsel said that \"it is the view of the Department of Defence that WikiLeaks obtained this material in circumstances that constitute a violation of US law, and that as long as WikiLeaks holds this material, the violation of the law is ongoing.\" In November 2010, Harold Koh, the Legal Adviser of the Department of State, wrote that the United States diplomatic cables leak \"were provided in violation of US law and without regard for the grave consequences of this action\" and \"as long as WikiLeaks holds such material, the violation of the law is ongoing\".\nOn 14 December 2010 the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks. Twitter decided to notify its users.\nIn 2011 a WikiLeaks volunteer became an FBI informant and Google was served with search warrants for the contents of email accounts belonging to WikiLeaks volunteers Herbert Snorrason and Smari McCarthy. The NSA discussed categorising WikiLeaks as a \"malicious foreign actor\" for surveillance purposes.",

        "context": "'Private biometrics is a form of encrypted biometrics, also called privacy-preserving biometric authentication methods, in which the biometric measurement is cryptographically processed such that no data stored in a data base can be (mis-) used to recover information about the human subject. \nBiometrics, in contrast to user pass words, are noisy data that slightly differ from measurement to measurement. Small variations input data prevent the use of traditional encryption or hashing.  \nThe introduction of  a fuzzy extractor was a pioneering contribution to nonetheless apply cryptographic techniques to inherently noisy biometric data. \n\n\n== Helper Data Schemes ==\nFuzzy Commitments were proposed as \"Helper Data Schemes\" for storing biometric templates.  \nA helper data system (HDS) is a cryptographic primitive designed to extract a consistent, high-entropy secret string (like a cryptographic key) from inherently noisy data, such as a biometric measurement. The primary purpose of an HDS is to enable reliable biometric authentication or identification while preserving privacy. It achieves this by ensuring that the stored data does not reveal sensitive information about the original biometric template or the extracted secret key to an attacker, even if the database is compromised by an insider attack. The data base stores a cryptographic hash of the quantized biometric measurement and the \"helper data\", in which the helper data is used to bias the quantization process. According to an information theoretical proof, helper data reveal no information about the biometric. The cryptograph strength of the hash function ensures that it is not computationally feasible to reconstruct the original nor any biometric features from the hash.",

It was first held in 2004 at MIT, and was also held at MIT in 2005, both times in February.  TCC  became an IACR-sponsored workshop in 2006. The founding steering committee consists of Mihir Bellare, Ivan Damgard, Oded Goldreich, Shafi Goldwasser, Johan Hastad, Russell Impagliazzo, Ueli Maurer, Silvio Micali, Moni Naor, and Tatsuaki Okamoto.\nThe importance of the theoretical study of Cryptography is widely recognized by now. This area has contributed much to the practice of cryptography and secure systems as well as to the theory of computation at large.\nThe needs of the theoretical cryptography (TC) community are best understood in relation to the two communities between which it resides: the Theory of Computation (TOC) community and the Cryptography/Security community. All three communities have grown in volume in recent years. This increase in volume makes the hosting of TC by the existing TOC and Crypto conferences quite problematic. Furthermore, the perspectives of TOC and Crypto on TC do not necessarily fit the internal perspective of TC and the interests of TC. All these indicate a value in the establishment of an independent specialized conference. A dedicated conference not only provides opportunities for research dissemination and interaction, but helps shape the field, give it a recognizable identity, and communicate its message.\n\n\n=== Real World Crypto Symposium ===\nThe Real World Crypto Symposium is a conference for applied cryptography research, which was started in 2012 by Kenny Paterson and Nigel Smart. The winner of the Levchin Prize is announced at RWC.\n\nAnnouncements made at the symposium include the first known chosen prefix attack on SHA-1 and the inclusion of end-to-end encryption in Facebook Messenger. Also, the introduction of the E4 chip took place at RWC. Flaws in messaging apps such as WhatsApp were also presented there.",

        "context": "=== Advantages of application-level encryption ===\nOne of the most important advantages of application-level encryption is the fact that application-level encryption has the potential to simplify the encryption process used by a company. If an application encrypts the data that it writes/modifies from a database then a secondary encryption tool will not need to be integrated into the system. The second main advantage relates to the overarching theme of theft. Given that data is encrypted before it is written to the server, a hacker would need to have access to the database contents as well as the applications that were used to encrypt and decrypt the contents of the database in order to decrypt sensitive data.\n\n\n=== Disadvantages of application-level encryption ===\nThe first important disadvantage of Application-level encryption is that applications used by a firm will need to be modified to encrypt data themselves. This has the potential to consume a significant amount of time and other resources. Given the nature of opportunity cost firms may not believe that application-level encryption is worth the investment. In addition, application-level encryption may have a limiting effect on database performance. If all data on a database is encrypted by a multitude of different applications then it becomes impossible to index or search data on the database. To ground this in reality in the form of a basic example: it would be impossible to construct a glossary in a single language for a book that was written in 30 languages. Lastly the complexity of key management increases, as multiple different applications need to have the authority and access to encrypt data and write it to the database.\n\n\n== Risks of database encryption ==\nWhen discussing the topic of database encryption it is imperative to be aware of the risks that are involved in the process. The first set of risks are related to key management. If private keys are not managed in an \"isolated system\", system administrators with malicious intentions may have the ability to decrypt sensitive data using keys that they have access to. The fundamental principle of keys also gives rise to a potentially devastating risk: if keys are lost then the encrypted data is essentially lost as well, as decryption without keys is almost impossible.",

        "context": "When the patient visits a doctor, the latter spends time with the former discussing their medical problems and performing diagnostic services. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record information about the patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.\nIt is very important to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk if the doctor (or their designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt.",

It was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard contest, but it was not selected for standardization. Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish.\nTwofish's distinctive features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes, and a relatively complex key schedule. One half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm (key-dependent S-boxes). Twofish borrows some elements from other designs; for example, the pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT) from the SAFER family of ciphers. Twofish has a Feistel structure like DES. Twofish also employs a Maximum Distance Separable matrix.\nWhen it was introduced in 1998, Twofish was slightly slower than Rijndael (the chosen algorithm for Advanced Encryption Standard) for 128-bit keys, but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys. Since 2008, virtually all AMD and Intel processors have included hardware acceleration of the Rijndael algorithm via the AES instruction set; Rijndael implementations that use the instruction set are now orders of magnitude faster than (software) Twofish implementations.\nTwofish was designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and  Niels Ferguson: the \"extended Twofish team\" met to perform further cryptanalysis of Twofish. Other AES contest entrants included Stefan Lucks, Tadayoshi Kohno, and Mike Stay.\nThe Twofish cipher has not been patented, and the reference implementation has been placed in the public domain. As a result, the Twofish algorithm is free for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever. It is one of a few ciphers included in the OpenPGP standard (RFC 9580). However, Twofish has seen less widespread usage than Blowfish, which has been available longer.",

More importantly, the additive was generated not through a keyword, but by selecting lines at random from almanacs of industrial statistics. Such books were deemed dull enough to not arouse suspicion if an agent was searched (particularly as the agents' cover stories were as businessmen), and to have such high entropy density as to provide a very secure additive. Of course the figures from such a book are not actually uniformly distributed (there is an excess of \"0\" and \"1\" (see Benford's Law), and sequential numbers are likely to be somewhat similar), but nevertheless they have much higher entropy density than passphrases and the like; at any rate, in practice they seem never to have been successfully cryptanalysed.\nThe weaker version generated the additive from the text of a novel or similar book (at least one Rote Kapelle member actually used The Good Soldier Schweik). This text was converted to a digital additive using a technique similar to a straddling checkerboard.\nThe ultimate development along these lines was the VIC cipher, used in the 1950s by Reino H\u00e4yh\u00e4nen. By this time, most Soviet agents were instead using one-time pads. However, despite the theoretical perfection of the one-time pad, in practice they were sometimes broken due to reuse of 'one-time' cipher pages in practice, while VIC was not.",

        "context": "Database encryption can generally be defined as a process that uses an algorithm to transform data stored in a database into \"cipher text\" that is incomprehensible without first being decrypted. It can therefore be said that the purpose of database encryption is to protect the data stored in a database from being accessed by individuals with potentially \"malicious\" intentions. The act of encrypting a database also reduces the incentive for individuals to hack the aforementioned database as \"meaningless\" encrypted data adds extra steps for hackers to retrieve the data. There are multiple techniques and technologies available for database encryption, the most important of which will be detailed in this article.\n\n\n== Transparent/External database encryption ==\nTransparent data encryption (often abbreviated as TDE) is used to encrypt an entire database, which therefore involves encrypting \"data at rest\". Data at rest can generally be defined as \"inactive\" data that is not currently being edited or pushed across a network. As an example, a text file stored on a computer is \"at rest\" until it is opened and edited. Data at rest are stored on physical storage media solutions such as tapes or hard disk drives. The act of storing large amounts of sensitive data on physical storage media naturally raises concerns of security and theft. TDE ensures that the data on physical storage media cannot be read by malicious individuals that may have the intention to steal them. Data that cannot be read is worthless, thus reducing the incentive for theft. Perhaps the most important strength that is attributed to TDE is its transparency. Given that TDE encrypts all data it can be said that no applications need to be altered in order for TDE to run correctly. It is important to note that TDE encrypts the entirety of the database as well as backups of the database. The transparent element of TDE has to do with the fact that TDE encrypts on \"the page level\", which essentially means that data is encrypted when stored and decrypted when it is called into the system's memory. The contents of the database are encrypted using a symmetric key that is often referred to as a \"database encryption key\".",

The TCSEC sets the basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of computer security controls built into a computer system (\u201cOrange Book, section B1\u201d). Today, the applications and operating systems contain features that comply with TCSEC levels C2 and B1 except they lack homomorphic encryption and so do not process data encrypted at rest. We typically, if not always, obtained waivers, because there was not a known work around. Adding private biometrics to these operating systems and applications resolves this issue.\nFor example, consider the case of a typical MySQL database. To query MySQL in a reasonable period of time, we need data that maps to indexes that maps to queries that maps to end user data.  To do this, we work with plaintext. The only way to encrypt this is to encrypt the entire data store, and to decrypt the entire data store, prior to use. Since data use is constant, the data is never encrypted. Thus, in the past we would apply for waivers because there was no known work around. Now using private biometrics, we can match and do operations on data that is always encrypted.",

This meant that there were many operations where codes broken by Bletchley Park played an important role, but this was not present in the history of those events.\nAfter the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work. Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as \"the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled\". That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.\nWith the publication of F. W. Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret in 1974 public discussion of Bletchley Park's work in the English speaking world finally became accepted, although some former staff considered themselves bound to silence forever. Winterbotham's book was written from memory and although officially allowed, there was no access to archives.\nNot until July 2009 did the British government fully acknowledge the contribution of the many people working at Bletchley Park. Only then was a commemorative medal struck to be presented to those involved. The gilded medal bears the inscription GC&CS 1939\u20131945 Bletchley Park and its Outstations.\n\n\n=== Decline and partial demolition ===\nThe site passed through a succession of hands and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college, and by various government agencies, including the GPO and the Civil Aviation Authority.

These tracking methods are usually allowed by platforms by default. Web browsing history is also collected by cookies on websites, which could be divided into two kinds, first-party cookies and third-party cookies. Third-party cookies are usually embedded on first-party websites and collect information from them. Third-party cookies have higher efficiency and data aggregation ability than first-party cookies. While first-party cookies only have access to users' data on one website, third-party cookies could combine data collected from different websites to make the image of the user more complete. Meanwhile, several third-party cookies could exist on the same website.\nWith enough information available, users could be identified without logging into their accounts.\nWhen third-party cookies collect the web browsing history of users from multiple websites, more information leads to more privacy concerns. For example, a user browses news on one website and searches for medical information on the other website. When the web browsing history from these two websites is combined, the user may be considered interested in news related to medical topics. When browsing history from different websites is combined, it could reflect a more complete image of the person.\n\n\n=== Scandals ===\nIn 2006, AOL released a large amount of data of its users, including search history. Although no user IDs or names was included, users could be identified based on the browsing history released. For example, user No. 4417749 was identified with her search history over three months.\nIn 2020, Avast, a popular antivirus software, has been accused of selling browsing history to third parties. It is under preliminary investigation of this accusation by officials of the Czech Republic. The report shows that Avast sold users' data through Jumpshot, a marketing analytics tool. Avast claimed that users' personal information was not included in the leak. However, browsing history could be used to identify users. Avast shut down Jumpshot as a reply to this issue.",

However, one form of deniable encryption allows its users to decrypt the ciphertext to produce a different (innocuous but plausible) plaintext and plausibly claim that it is what they encrypted. The holder of the ciphertext will not be able to differentiate between the true plaintext, and the bogus-claim plaintext. In general, one ciphertext cannot be decrypted to all possible plaintexts unless the key is as large as the plaintext, so it is not practical in most cases for a ciphertext to reveal no information whatsoever about its plaintext. However, some schemes allow decryption to decoy plaintexts that are close to the original in some metric (such as edit distance).\nModern deniable encryption techniques exploit the fact that without the key, it is infeasible to distinguish between ciphertext from block ciphers and data generated by a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (the cipher's pseudorandom permutation properties).\nThis is used in combination with some decoy data that the user would plausibly want to keep confidential that will be revealed to the attacker, claiming that this is all there is. This is a form of steganography.\nIf the user does not supply the correct key for the truly secret data, decrypting it will result in apparently random data, indistinguishable from not having stored any particular data there.\n\n\n=== Examples ===",

In 1923, they were employed for diplomatic communications by the German diplomatic establishment. The Weimar Republic Diplomatic Service began using the method in about 1920. The breaking of poor Soviet cryptography by the British, with messages made public for political reasons in two instances in the 1920s (ARCOS case), appear to have caused the Soviet Union to adopt one-time pads for some purposes by around 1930. KGB spies are also known to have used pencil and paper one-time pads more recently. Examples include Colonel Rudolf Abel, who was arrested and convicted in New York City in the 1950s, and the 'Krogers' (i.e., Morris and Lona Cohen), who were arrested and convicted of espionage in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Both were found with physical one-time pads in their possession.\nA number of nations have used one-time pad systems for their sensitive traffic. Leo Marks reports that the British Special Operations Executive used one-time pads in World War II to encode traffic between its offices. One-time pads for use with its overseas agents were introduced late in the war. A few British one-time tape cipher machines include the Rockex and Noreen. The German Stasi Sprach Machine was also capable of using one time tape that East Germany, Russia, and even Cuba used to send encrypted messages to their agents.\nThe World War II voice scrambler SIGSALY was also a form of one-time system. It added noise to the signal at one end and removed it at the other end. The noise was distributed to the channel ends in the form of large shellac records that were manufactured in unique pairs. There were both starting synchronization and longer-term phase drift problems that arose and had to be solved before the system could be used.",

By doing this, it behaves similarly to a biological virus, which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. While some viruses are harmless or mere hoaxes, most are considered malicious.\nComputer worm\nLike a virus, a worm is also a self-replicating program. It differs from a virus in that (a.) it propagates through computer networks without user intervention; and (b.) does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Nonetheless, many people use the terms \"virus\" and \"worm\" interchangeably to describe any self-propagating program.\nKeystroke logging\nA keylogger is a tool designed to record (\"log\") every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval, usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine. Some keyloggers use virus-, trojan-, and rootkit-like methods to conceal themselves. However, some of them are used for legitimate purposes, even to enhance computer security. For example, a business may maintain a keylogger on a computer used at a point of sale to detect evidence of employee fraud.\nAttack patterns\nAttack patterns are defined as series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system. They can be used for testing purposes or locating potential vulnerabilities.

The PSPF is published by the Attorney-General's Department and covers security governance, information security, personal security, and physical security. A security classification can be applied to the information itself or an asset that holds information e.g., a USB or laptop.\nThe Australian Government uses four security classifications: OFFICIAL: Sensitive, PROTECTED, SECRET and TOP SECRET. The relevant security classification is based on the likely damage resulting from compromise of the information's confidentiality.\nAll other information from business operations and services requires a routine level of protection and is treated as OFFICIAL. Information that does not form part of official duty is treated as UNOFFICIAL.\nOFFICIAL and UNOFFICIAL are not security classifications and are not mandatory markings.\nCaveats are a warning that the information has special protections in addition to those indicated by the security classification of PROTECTED or higher (or in the case of the NATIONAL CABINET caveat, OFFICIAL: Sensitive or higher).

The parents were angry about the school district's secret use of webcams to view students and their friends and families in their homes. However, the parents were concerned that they themselves would have to bear a financial cost in paying for the district's litigation, and possible settlement or court-ordered penalty.\nThe group was concerned that the Robbins lawsuit would be costly, attract negative attention to the district while harming its \"civic tone\" and distracting from its educational mission, and take a long time to resolve. Particular attention was given to the fact that payment for the members of the class in the class action suit would effectively come from the district's taxpayers, if not its insurer. Lower Merion Parents did not, however, oppose a full investigation of the district's technological capabilities and of any abuses the district committed.\nOn March 2, 2010, more than 100 parents met in Narberth, Pennsylvania, to discuss the issues. Robbins' attorney Mark Haltzman requested an opportunity to speak to the group to update the parents, but was denied. The meeting mainly concerned whether the parents wanted the Robbins family to represent them, how to lift the court's \"gag order\" agreement that district officials and school board members not talk about the case without first consulting the Robbinses and their lawyer, and how to learn what actually happened with the laptops and webcams. One option opposing parents have is to file a motion to intervene, which is an agreement to be parties in the case, but with different interests than the plaintiff. A similar group called Parents in Support of the Lower Merion School District collected over 750 signatures by March 3 in an online petition. Philadelphia Weekly noted that \"Paradoxically, this group of Lower Merion parents are going to try to stop the gratuitous litigation by getting more lawyers involved.\"",

The Kurzsignale code system condensed messages into short codes consisting of short sequences for common terms such as \"convoy location\" so that additional descriptions would not be needed in the message. The resulting Kurzsignal was then encoded with the Enigma machine and subsequently transmitted as rapidly as possible, typically taking about 20 seconds. Typical length of an information or weather signal was about 25 characters.\nConventional RDF needed about a minute to fix the bearing of a radio signal, and the Kurzsignale protected against this. However, the huff-duff system which was in use by the Allies could cope with these short transmissions.\nThe fully automated burst transmission Kurier system, in testing from August 1944, could send a Kurzsignal in not more than 460 milliseconds; this was short enough to prevent location even by huff-duff and, if deployed, would have been a serious setback for Allied anti-submarine and code-breaking activities. By late 1944 the Kurier program was a top priority, but the war ended before the system was operational.\n\n\n== Short Weather cipher ==\nA similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the Wetterkurzschl\u00fcssel (Short Weather Cipher).

The term rootkit is a compound  of \"root\" (the traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and the word \"kit\" (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term \"rootkit\" has negative connotations through its association with malware.\nRootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root or administrator access. Obtaining this access is a result of direct attack on a system, i.e., exploiting a vulnerability (such as privilege escalation) or a password (obtained by cracking or social engineering tactics like \"phishing\"). Once installed, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain privileged access. Full control over a system means that existing software can be modified, including software that might otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.\nRootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavior-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem.

The second rule, now known as Kerckhoffs's principle, is still critically important.\n\n\n== Explanation of the principle ==\nKerckhoffs viewed cryptography as a rival to, and a better alternative than, steganographic encoding, which was common in the nineteenth century for hiding the meaning of military messages. One problem with encoding schemes is that they rely on humanly-held secrets such as \"dictionaries\" which disclose for example, the secret meaning of words. Steganographic-like dictionaries, once revealed, permanently compromise a corresponding encoding system. Another problem is that the risk of exposure increases as the number of users holding the secrets increases.\nNineteenth century cryptography, in contrast, used simple tables which provided for the transposition of alphanumeric characters, generally given row-column intersections which could be modified by keys which were generally short, numeric, and could be committed to human memory. The system was considered \"indecipherable\" because tables and keys do not convey meaning by themselves. Secret messages can be compromised only if a matching set of table, key, and message falls into enemy hands in a relevant time frame. Kerckhoffs viewed tactical messages as only having a few hours of relevance. Systems are not necessarily compromised, because their components (i.e. alphanumeric character tables and keys) can be easily changed.",

ARC also took the responsibility along with the IAF to transport Special Frontier Force (SFF) commandos from their trans-location at Sarsawa, 250 km north of New Delhi, though the SFF's own base is in Chakrata in Uttarakhand.\n\n\n== Project 596 ==\n\nThe United States supplied surveillance equipment to Aviation Research Centre to spy on China's nuclear programme and naval assets from 1962.\n\n\n== Kargil War ==\nIn 1999 during the Kargil War, after the Pakistani intrusion was detected, ARC was tasked to check if the Pakistanis had indeed crossed the Line of Control to the Indian side and violated the border agreement. A number of missions were flown by the ARC on request from the Indian Army and the PMO.\nSenior officials of the Indian armed forces including the Chief of Air Staff and Chief of Army staff highly commended the work done by ARC, quoting \"The electronic and optical information provided by the ARC before and during the actual operations was of immense value to the conduct of air strikes.\" Also the K. Subrahmanyam committee report into the Kargil war observed that \"No intelligence failures had been attributed on account of functioning of RAW and ARC. However, certain equipment inadequacies were highlighted such as satellite imagery and UAVs\".\n\n\n== Proposal of dissolution ==\nIn 2012, the Naresh Chandra Committee on national security recommended merger of ARC with R&AW, in view of ARC's turf wars with NTRO and DIA. As a part of larger reforms, backed by NSA Ajit Doval, Aviation Research Centre (ARC) was proposed to be shut down in 2015 and ARC's assets were to be divided between the National Technical Research Organisation and the Indian Air Force.\nHowever, it was not carried out and the agency continues to exist.",

Passengers whose credit card details were accessed were notified in April. They did not reveal details of the attack but said it seemed to be aimed at \"company intellectual property\" rather than information that could be used in identity theft.\nEasyJet was not obliged to notify passengers whose basic booking details were compromised but they announced the details because of an increase in phishing attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Passport details were not accessed.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office said they were investigating. The ICO said \"People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly.

The field will need to come to a consensus on the length of time to store EHRs, methods to ensure the future accessibility and compatibility of archived data with yet-to-be-developed retrieval systems, and how to ensure the physical and virtual security of the archives.\nAdditionally, considerations about the long-term storage of electronic health records are complicated by the possibility that the records might one day be used longitudinally and integrated across sites of care. Records have the potential to be created, used, edited, and viewed by multiple independent entities. These entities include, but are not limited to, primary care physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients. Mandl et al. have noted that \"choices about the structure and ownership of these records will have profound impact on the accessibility and privacy of patient information.\"\nThe required length of storage of an individual electronic health record will depend on national and state regulations, which are subject to change over time. Ruotsalainen and Manning have found that the typical preservation time of patient data varies between 20 and 100 years. In one example of how an EHR archive might function, their research \"describes a co-operative trusted notary archive (TNA) which receives health data from different EHR-systems, stores data together with associated meta-information for long periods and distributes EHR-data objects. TNA can store objects in XML-format and prove the integrity of stored data with the help of event records, timestamps and archive e-signatures.\"\nIn addition to the TNA archive described by Ruotsalainen and Manning, other combinations of EHR systems and archive systems are possible. Again, overall requirements for the design and security of the system and its archive will vary and must function under ethical and legal principles specific to the time and place.",

According to Under Secretary Krach in late 2020, \"when we looked at this six months ago it looked like Huawei was unstoppable. It looked like they were going to run the table in Europe and everywhere else.\u201d At a February 18, 2020 press conference in London, Huawei's president of carrier business Ryan Ding announced, \"We have 91 commercial 5G contracts worldwide, including 47 from Europe.\" Following the U.S. government's campaign to reduce international reliance on Chinese-made telecommunications equipment, Huawei's deals outside of China decreased from 91 to 12.\nAccording to the United States, Chinese national intelligence laws can be used to force companies like Huawei, ZTE, and other Chinese telecommunication equipment vendors to turn over any information or data upon the request of the Chinese Communist Party government. The U.S. State Department argues that these laws thus make Huawei and similar vendors \"an arm of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) surveillance state.\"\nHuawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a veteran of the People's Liberation Army's engineering corps. Many of the company's crucial first contracts were with the Chinese army. In 1996, the Chinese government banned competition from foreign suppliers, and Huawei may have received a $30 billion line of credit from the China Development Bank, along with other state-backed financing. This gave the company control over the Chinese domestic market and enabled it to fuel rapid international expansion by offering discounts.  Forced technology transfers from foreign companies, and several cases of technology theft also contributed the company's growth, including the theft of router software from Cisco and a jury finding that Huawei committed industrial espionage against T-Mobile.\nAccording to the United States, the rise of Huawei was the fulfillment of decades of careful planning. Supported by the CCP, Huawei benefited from state protection against foreign competitors, billions in funding from the Chinese government, as well as forced technology transfers and well documented instances of outright technology theft.

        "context": "== Overview ==\nData anonymization has been defined as a \"process by which personal data is altered in such a way that a data subject can no longer be identified directly or indirectly, either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party.\" Data anonymization may enable the transfer of information across a boundary, such as between two departments within an agency or between two agencies, while reducing the risk of unintended disclosure, and in certain environments in a manner that enables evaluation and analytics post-anonymization.\nIn the context of medical data, anonymized data refers to data from which the patient cannot be identified by the recipient of the information. The name, address, and full postcode must be removed, together with any other information which, in conjunction with other data held by or disclosed to the recipient, could identify the patient.\nThere will always be a risk that anonymized data may not  stay anonymous over time. Pairing the anonymized dataset with other data,  clever techniques and raw power are some of the ways previously anonymous data sets have become de-anonymized; The data subjects are no longer anonymous.\nDe-anonymization is the reverse process in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other data sources to re-identify the anonymous data source. \nGeneralization and perturbation are the two popular anonymization approaches for relational data.  The process of obscuring data with the ability to re-identify it later is also called pseudonymization and is one way companies can store data in a way that is HIPAA compliant.",

        "context": "==== United Kingdom ====\n\nMI6 reportedly infiltrated an Al Qaeda website and replaced the instructions for making a pipe bomb with the recipe for making cupcakes.\nIn October 2010, Iain Lobban, the director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), said the UK faces a \"real and credible\" threat from cyber attacks by hostile states and criminals and government systems are targeted 1,000 times each month, such attacks threatened the UK's economic future, and some countries were already using cyber assaults to put pressure on other nations.\nOn 12 November 2013, financial organizations in London conducted cyber war games dubbed \"Waking Shark 2\" to simulate massive internet-based attacks against bank and other financial organizations. The Waking Shark 2 cyber war games followed a similar exercise in Wall Street.\n\n\n=== Middle East ===\n\n\n==== Iran ====\n\nIran has been both victim and perpetrator of several cyberwarfare operations. Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field.\n\nIn September 2010, Iran was attacked by the Stuxnet worm, thought to specifically target its Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. It was a 500-kilobyte computer worm that infected at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including the Natanz uranium-enrichment plant. Although the official authors of Stuxnet haven't been officially identified, Stuxnet is believed to be developed and deployed by the United States and Israel. The worm is said to be the most advanced piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the profile of cyberwarfare.\nIranian Cyber Police department, FATA, was dismissed one year after its creation in 2011 because of the arrest and death of Sattar Behesti, a blogger, in the custody of FATA. Since then, the main responsible institution for the cyberwarfare in Iran is the \"Cyber Defense Command\" operating under the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces.\nThe Iranian state sponsored group MuddyWater is active since at least 2017 and is responsible for many cyber attacks on various sectors.",

        "context": "== Combating computer crime ==\nDue to cybercriminals using the internet for cross-border attacks and crimes, the process of prosecuting cybercriminals has been difficult. The number of vulnerabilities that a cybercriminal could use as points of opportunity to exploit has also increased over the years. From 2008 to 2014 alone, there has been a 17.75% increase in vulnerabilities across all online devices. The internet's expansive reach causes the damage inflicted to people to be magnified since many methods of cybercrime have the opportunity to reach many people. The availability of virtual spaces has allowed cybercrime to become an everyday occurrence. In 2018, the Internet Crime Complaint Center received 351,937 complaints of cybercrime, which led to $2.7 billion lost.\n\n\n=== Investigation ===\nIn a criminal investigation, a computer can be a source of evidence (see digital forensics). Even when a computer is not directly used for criminal purposes, it may contain records of value to criminal investigators in the form of a logfile. In many countries, Internet service providers are required by law to keep their logfiles for a predetermined amount of time.\nThere are many ways for cybercrime to take place, and investigations tend to start with an IP Address trace; however, that does not necessarily enable detectives to solve a case. Different types of high-tech crime may also include elements of low-tech crime, and vice versa, making cybercrime investigators an indispensable part of modern law enforcement. Methods of cybercrime detective work are dynamic and constantly improving, whether in closed police units or in the framework of international cooperation.",

In multi-secret sharing designed by Matthew K. Franklin and Moti Yung, multiple points of the polynomial host secrets; the method was found useful in numerous applications from coding to multi-party computations. In space efficient secret sharing, devised by Abhishek Parakh and Subhash Kak, each share is roughly the size of the secret divided by k \u2212 1.\nThis scheme makes use of repeated polynomial interpolation and has potential applications in secure information dispersal on the Web and in\nsensor networks. This method is based on data partitioning involving the roots of a polynomial in finite field. Some vulnerabilities of related space efficient secret sharing schemes were pointed out later. They show that a scheme based on interpolation method cannot be used to implement a (k, n) scheme when the k secrets to be distributed are inherently generated from a polynomial of degree less than k \u2212 1, and the scheme does not work if all of the secrets to be shared are the same, etc.",

They regulate almost every aspect of biological behavior and allow cells to carry out physiological processes and responses to perturbations. Understanding the structure and the dynamic behavior of gene networks is therefore one of the paramount challenges of systems biology, with immediate practical repercussions in several applications that are beyond basic research.\nThere are several methods for reverse engineering gene regulatory networks by using molecular biology and data science methods. They have been generally divided into six classes:\n\nCoexpression methods are based on the notion that if two genes exhibit a similar expression profile, they may be related although no causation can be simply inferred from coexpression.\nSequence motif methods analyze gene promoters to find specific transcription factor binding domains. If a transcription factor is predicted to bind a promoter of a specific gene, a regulatory connection can be hypothesized.\nChromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) methods investigate the genome-wide profile of DNA binding of chosen transcription factors to infer their downstream gene networks.\nOrthology methods transfer gene network knowledge from one species to another.\nLiterature methods implement text mining and manual research to identify putative or experimentally-proven gene network connections.\nTranscriptional complexes methods leverage information on protein-protein interactions between transcription factors, thus extending the concept of gene networks to include transcriptional regulatory complexes.\nOften, gene network reliability is tested by genetic perturbation experiments followed by dynamic modelling, based on the principle that removing one network node has predictable effects on the functioning of the remaining nodes of the network.\nApplications of the reverse engineering of gene networks range from understanding mechanisms of plant physiology to the highlighting of new targets for anticancer therapy.",

        "context": "== Details ==\nAny cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-2 or SHA-3, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-x, where x is the hash function used (e.g. HMAC-SHA256 or HMAC-SHA3-512). The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output, and the size and quality of the key.\nHMAC uses two passes of hash computation. Before either pass, the secret key is used to derive two keys \u2013 inner and outer. Next, the first pass of the hash algorithm produces an internal hash derived from the message and the inner key. The second pass produces the final HMAC code derived from the inner hash result and the outer key. Thus the algorithm provides better immunity against length extension attacks.\nAn iterative hash function (one that uses the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction) breaks up a message into blocks of a fixed size and iterates over them with a compression function. For example, SHA-256 operates on 512-bit blocks. The size of the output of HMAC is the same as that of the underlying hash function (e.g., 256 and 512 bits in the case of SHA-256 and SHA3-512, respectively), although it can be truncated if desired.\nHMAC does not encrypt the message. Instead, the message (encrypted or not) must be sent alongside the HMAC hash. Parties with the secret key will hash the message again themselves, and if it is authentic, the received and computed hashes will match.\nThe definition and analysis of the HMAC construction was first published in 1996 in a paper by Mihir Bellare, Ran Canetti, and Hugo Krawczyk, and they also wrote RFC 2104 in 1997. The 1996 paper also defined a nested variant called NMAC (Nested MAC). FIPS PUB 198 generalizes and standardizes the use of HMACs. HMAC is used within the IPsec, SSH and TLS protocols and for JSON Web Tokens.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThis definition is taken from RFC 2104:",

        "context": "==== Soviet signals ====\nSoviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 1939\u201340, John Tiltman (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at Sarafand in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.\n\n\n==== Japanese signals ====\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the Far East Combined Bureau (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then Colombo, Ceylon, then Kilindini, Mombasa, Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune. The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the Wireless Experimental Centre at Delhi, India.\nIn early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in Hut 7, under John Tiltman.\nBy mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at Arlington Hall, Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: \"Only now are the British codebreakers (like John Tiltman, Hugh Foss, and Eric Nave) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers\".\n\n\n== Post-war uses and legacy ==\nThe Government Code & Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), moving to Eastcote in 1946 and to Cheltenham in 1951.\n\n\n=== Continued secrecy and official recognition ===",

        "context": "== Function ==\n\n Aerial surveillance, SIGINT operations, photo reconnaissance flights (PHOTINT), monitoring of borders, imagery intelligence (IMINT) were the main functions of the Aviation Research Centre (ARC).\nThe aircraft were fitted with state-of-the-art electronic surveillance equipment and long range cameras capable of taking pictures of targets from very high altitudes. ARC also took the responsibility along with the IAF to transport Special Frontier Force (SFF) commandos from their trans-location at Sarsawa, 250 km north of New Delhi, though the SFF's own base is in Chakrata in Uttarakhand.\n\n\n== Project 596 ==\n\nThe United States supplied surveillance equipment to Aviation Research Centre to spy on China's nuclear programme and naval assets from 1962.\n\n\n== Kargil War ==\nIn 1999 during the Kargil War, after the Pakistani intrusion was detected, ARC was tasked to check if the Pakistanis had indeed crossed the Line of Control to the Indian side and violated the border agreement. A number of missions were flown by the ARC on request from the Indian Army and the PMO.\nSenior officials of the Indian armed forces including the Chief of Air Staff and Chief of Army staff highly commended the work done by ARC, quoting \"The electronic and optical information provided by the ARC before and during the actual operations was of immense value to the conduct of air strikes.\" Also the K. Subrahmanyam committee report into the Kargil war observed that \"No intelligence failures had been attributed on account of functioning of RAW and ARC. However, certain equipment inadequacies were highlighted such as satellite imagery and UAVs\".\n\n\n== Proposal of dissolution ==\nIn 2012, the Naresh Chandra Committee on national security recommended merger of ARC with R&AW, in view of ARC's turf wars with NTRO and DIA. As a part of larger reforms, backed by NSA Ajit Doval, Aviation Research Centre (ARC) was proposed to be shut down in 2015 and ARC's assets were to be divided between the National Technical Research Organisation and the Indian Air Force.\nHowever, it was not carried out and the agency continues to exist.",

The aggregator and financial institution may agree on a data feed arrangement activated on the customer's request, using an Open Financial Exchange (OFX) standard to request and deliver information to the site selected by the customer as the place from which they will view their account data. Agreements provide an opportunity for institutions to negotiate to protect their customers' interests and offer aggregators the opportunity to provide a robust service. Aggregators who agree with information providers to extract data without using an OFX standard may reach a lower level of consensual relationship; therefore, \"screen scraping\" may be used to obtain account data, but for business or other reasons, the aggregator may decide to obtain prior consent and negotiate the terms on which customer data is made available. \"Screen scraping\" without consent by the content provider has the advantage of allowing subscribers to view almost any and all accounts they happen to have opened anywhere on the Internet through one website.\n\n\n== Outlook ==\nOver time, the transfer of large amounts of account data from the account provider to the aggregator's server could develop into a comprehensive profile of a user, detailing their banking and credit card transactions, balances, securities transactions and portfolios, and travel history and preferences. As the sensitivity to data protection considerations grows, it is likely there will be a considerable focus on the extent to which data aggregators may seek to use this data either for their own use or to share it  with third parties and operator(s) of the website on which the service is offered.\n\n\n== References ==",

The generally held belief within Myanmar is that a Bhikkhu (monk) named Shin Arahan from Thaton introduced Theravada Buddhism to the Bagan Kingdom. Anawrahta invited monks from Sri Lanka, among others, after banishing Ari priests in an attempt to revitalize a more orthodox form of Buddhism. Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa sent a copy of the Tripitaka to Anawrahta.\nIn the 1150s, the Burmese king Sithu I visited the court of Parakramabahu I in Sri Lanka appointing an ambassador. According to the Sri Lankan chronicle C\u016b\u1e37ava\u1e43sa, that Sithu caught sight of a letter addressed to the King of Cambodia. He attempted to stop Sri Lanka's elephant trade with Cambodia and later captured a lesser Sinhalese princess on her way to be married to a prince of Cambodia, sparking a war between the two kingdoms in 1180.\nThe influence of Burmese architecture on Sri Lanka's religious building in Polonnaruwa is also evident. The Satmahalprasada, a setup with an unusual pyramid like form in several levels or storeys in Polonnnaruwa is the best example.\nKing Dhammazedi of the Hanthawaddy kingdom sent all the monks in Lower Burma to be re-ordained on the in Sri Lanka making Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhism the dominant form of Buddhism in Myanmar. In the late 18th century, King Bodawpaya of the Konbaung Dynasty re-introduced the upasampad\u0101 ordination system to Sri Lanka, establishing the Amarapura Nikaya. The establishment of the Amarapura Nikaya was also significant as a monastic lineage was established through collective action rather than the patronage of a king.",

Unlike traditional obfuscation, which leaves code accessible to static analysis, stegomalware hides payloads entirely within cover media until runtime execution, defeating static analysis.\nThe documented rise in real-world stegomalware attacks\u2014from advanced persistent threats to financial cybercrime\u2014demonstrates active threat growth. International law enforcement and academic focus (CUIng, SIMARGL, UNCOVER) reflects recognition that stegomalware poses a significant security challenge for enterprises, governments, and users.\nDespite advances in steganalysis, detection rates remain insufficient for production environments, and attacker evasion techniques continue improving.

The hack was revealed by The Register on May 23. The CBP learned of the data breach on May 31, over three weeks after the discovery of the hack. CBP acknowledged a breach on that date but didn't reveal the contractor involved, but the Microsoft Word document title pointed to Perceptics. CBP also stated CBP said \"as of today, none of the image data has been identified on the dark web or internet.\"\nIdentifiable information such as faces were stolen. Somewhere under 100,000 images were taken, which were part of a 45-day dataset from one port of entry. The data was transferred off of the CBP's systems to Perceptics's systems, a violation of CBP policy. The Register showed that data was available on Tor, and included images, HR records, databases, DHS manuals, signed NDAs, and business plans. Distributed Denial of Secrets mirrored the data to the open web, making it more easily accessible. Later, The Register identified images taken at border crossings at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and Columbus, New Mexico, and Hidalgo, Texas.\nPerceptics demoed the technology for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and 50 gigabytes of photos over two months in 2017 were identified in the hack and published on Vice News's Motherboard.\nCBP suspended the contract, citing \"conduct indicating a lack of business honesty or integrity\". Suspensions are a rare action. In September 2019, Perceptics and CBP signed an agreement, where CBP stated the collection of data was \"completely unacceptable\" but not unethical or illegal, and Perceptics agreeing to security reforms and monitoring.\nA hacker claimed to have access to Perceptics's systems for four months and demanded a ransom. The data was made publicly available by Distributed Denial of Secrets.\nThe breach led to scrutiny from Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. Edward J. Markey, Sen. Ron Wyden, Rep.

        "context": "An individual who performs medical transcription is known as a medical transcriber (MT) or a Medical Language Specialist (MLS). The equipment used is called a medical transcriber, e.g., a cassette player with foot controls operated by the MT for report playback and transcription.\nEducation and training can be obtained through certificate or diploma programs, distance learning, or on-the-job training offered in some hospitals, although there are countries currently employing transcriptionists that require 18 months to 2 years of specialized MT training. Working in medical transcription leads to a mastery in medical terminology and editing, ability to listen and type simultaneously, utilization of playback controls on the transcriber (machine), and use of foot pedal to play and adjust dictations \u2013 all while maintaining a steady rhythm of execution. Medical transcription training normally includes coursework in medical terminology, anatomy, editing and proofreading, grammar and punctuation, typing, medical record types and formats, and healthcare documentation.\nWhile medical transcription does not mandate registration or certification, individual MTs may seek out registration/certification for personal or professional reasons. Obtaining a certificate from a medical transcription training program does not entitle an MT to use the title of Certified Medical Transcriptionist. A Certified Healthcare Documentation Specialist (CHDS) credential can be earned by passing a certification examination conducted solely by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), formerly the American Association for Medical Transcription (AAMT), as the credentialing designation they created. AHDI also offers the credential of Registered Healthcare Documentation Specialist (RHDS). According to AHDI, RHDS is an entry-level credential while the CHDS is an advanced level. AHDI maintains a list of approved medical transcription schools. Generally, certified medical transcriptionists earn more than their non-certified counterparts. It is also notable that training through an educational program that is approved by AHDI will increase the chances of an MT getting certified and getting hired.",

According to Wired UK, most of the board members to whom they spoke said they had little involvement with WikiLeaks. Some said they did not know they were mentioned on the site, nor how they got there. Computer security expert Ben Laurie said he had been a member of the board \"since before the beginning\", but he was not \"really sure what the advisory board means.\" Former board member Phillip Adams criticised the board, saying that Assange \"has never asked for advice. The advisory board was pretty clearly window dressing, so he went for people identified with progressive policies around the place.\" Assange responded by calling the advisory board \"pretty informal\".\nWhen asked to join their initial advisory board, the promininent critic of secrecy Steven Aftergood declined; he said to Time that \"they have a very idealistic view of the nature of leaking and its impact.

By exploiting hardware virtualization features such as Intel VT or AMD-V, this type of rootkit runs in Ring -1 and hosts the target operating system as a virtual machine, thereby enabling the rootkit to intercept hardware calls made by the original operating system. Unlike normal hypervisors, they do not have to load before the operating system, but can load into an operating system before promoting it into a virtual machine. A hypervisor rootkit does not have to make any modifications to the kernel of the target to subvert it; however, that does not mean that it cannot be detected by the guest operating system. For example, timing differences may be detectable in CPU instructions. The \"SubVirt\" laboratory rootkit, developed jointly by Microsoft and University of Michigan researchers, is an academic example of a virtual-machine\u2013based rootkit (VMBR),\nwhile Blue Pill software is another. In 2009, researchers from Microsoft and North Carolina State University demonstrated a hypervisor-layer anti-rootkit called Hooksafe, which provides generic protection against kernel-mode rootkits. Windows 10 introduced a new feature called \"Device Guard\", that takes advantage of virtualization to provide independent external protection of an operating system against rootkit-type malware.",

Cyber Command is the newest global combatant and its sole mission is cyberspace, outside the traditional battlefields of land, sea, air and space.\" It will attempt to find and, when necessary, neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military computer networks.\nAlexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command, listing the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack, including \"traditional battlefield prizes \u2013 command-and-control systems at military headquarters, air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate.\"\nOne cyber warfare scenario, Cyber-ShockWave, which was wargamed on the cabinet level by former administration officials, raised issues ranging from the National Guard to the power grid to the limits of statutory authority.\nThe distributed nature of internet based attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party, meaning that it is unclear when a specific act should be considered an act of war.\nExamples of cyberwarfare driven by political motivations can be found worldwide. In 2008, Russia began a cyber attack on the Georgian government website, which was carried out along with Georgian military operations in South Ossetia. In 2008, Chinese \"nationalist hackers\" attacked CNN as it reported on Chinese repression on Tibet.
